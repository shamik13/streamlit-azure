 j the other minister it was nearing midnight and the prime minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. he was waiting for a call from the president of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else. the more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him the more clearly the prime minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. this particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week as though anyone needed reminding but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government’s fault. the prime minister’s pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations for they were neither fair nor true. how on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing it was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. the bridge was fewer than ten years old and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. and how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the west country that had caused so much damage to both people and property and was it his fault that one of his junior ministers herbert chorley had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family “a grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent had concluded barely concealing his own broad grin. and unfortunately this was perfectly true. the prime minister felt it himself people really did seem more miserable than usual. even the weather was dismal all this chilly mist in the middle of july. ... it wasn’t right it wasn’t normal. ... he turned over the second page of the memo saw how much longer it went on and gave it up as a bad job. stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. it was a handsome room with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. with a slight shiver the prime minister got up and moved over to the window looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. it was then as he stood with his back to the room that he heard a soft cough behind him. he froze nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. he knew that cough. he had heard it before. he turned very slowly to face the empty room. “hello?” he said trying to sound braver than he felt. for a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. however a voice responded at once a crisp decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. it was coming — as the prime minister had known at the first cough — from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room. “to the prime minister of muggles. urgent we meet. kindly respond immediately. sincerely fudge.” the man in the painting looked inquiringly at the prime minister. “er,” said the prime minister “listen. ... it’s not a very good time for me. ... i’m waiting for a telephone call you see . . . from the president of — ” “that can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. the prime minister’s heart sank. he had been afraid of that. “but i really was rather hoping to speak — ” “we shall arrange for the president to forget to call. he will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the little man. “kindly respond immediately to mr. fudge.” “i ... oh ... very well,” said the prime minister weakly. “yes i’ll see fudge.” he hurried back to his desk straightening his tie as he went. he had barely resumed his seat and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. he watched trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm as a portly man appeared within the flames spinning as fast as a top. seconds later he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak a lime-green bowler hat in his hand. “ah ... prime minister,” said cornelius fudge striding forward with his hand outstretched. “good to see you again.” the prime minister could not honestly return this compliment so said nothing at all. he was not remotely pleased to see fudge whose occasional appearances apart from being downright alarming in themselves generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. furthermore fudge was looking distinctly careworn. he was thinner balder and grayer and his face had a crumpled look. the prime minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before and it never boded well. “how can i help you?” he said shaking fudge’s hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk. “difficult to know where to begin,” muttered fudge pulling up the chair sitting down and placing his green bowler upon his knees. “what a week what a week ...” “had a bad one too have you?” asked the prime minister stiffly hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from fudge. “yes of course,” said fudge rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the prime minister. “i’ve been having the same week you have prime minister. the brockdale bridge ... the bones and vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the west country ...” “you — er — your — i mean to say some of your people were — were involved in those — those things were they?” fudge fixed the prime minister with a rather stern look. “of course they were,” he said. “surely you’ve realized what’s going on?” “i ...” hesitated the prime minister. it was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike fudge’s visits so much. he was after all the prime minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. but of course it had been like this from his very first meeting with fudge on his very first evening as prime minister. he remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day. he had been standing alone in this very office savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming when he had heard a cough behind him just like tonight and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him announcing that the minister of magic was about to arrive and introduce himself. naturally he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. he had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. he had remained speechless throughout fudge’s kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the ministry of magic took responsibility for the whole wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them. it was said fudge a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control the prime minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). fudge had then patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck prime minister in a fatherly sort of way. “not to worry,” he had said “it’s odds-on you’ll never see me again. i’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going on our end something that’s likely to affect the muggles — the non-magical population i should say. otherwise it’s live and let live. and i must say you’re taking it a lot better than your predecessor. he tried to throw me out the window thought i was a hoax planned by the opposition.” at this the prime minister had found his voice at last. “you’re — you’re not a hoax then?” it had been his last desperate hope. “no,” said fudge gently. “no i’m afraid i’m not. look.” and he had turned the prime minister’s teacup into a gerbil. “but,” said the prime minister breathlessly watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech “but why — why has nobody told me — ” “the minister of magic only reveals him or herself to the muggle prime minister of the day,” said fudge poking his wand back inside his jacket. “we find it the best way to maintain secrecy.” “but then,” bleated the prime minister “why hasn’t a former prime minister warned me — ” at this fudge had actually laughed. “my dear prime minister are you ever going to tell anybody?” still chortling fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace stepped into the emerald flames and vanished with a whooshing sound. the prime minister had stood there quite motionless and realized that he would never as long as he lived dare mention this encounter to a living soul for who in the wide world would believe him the shock had taken a little while to wear off. for a time he had tried to convince himself that fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. in a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced fudge’s arrival. to the prime minister’s dismay however the portrait had proved impossible to remove. when several carpenters a builder or two an art historian and the chancellor of the exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall the prime minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning or else scratching his nose even once or twice simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. however he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened. then three years ago on a night very like tonight the prime minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of fudge who had burst out of the fireplace sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. before the prime minister could ask why he was dripping all over the axminster fudge had started ranting about a prison the prime minister had never heard of a man named “serious” black something that sounded like “hogwarts,” and a boy called harry potter none of which made the remotest sense to the prime minister. ... fve just come from azkaban,” fudge had panted tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. “middle of the north sea you know nasty flight . . . the dementors are in uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had a breakout before. anyway i had to come to you prime minister. black’s a known muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin you-know-who. ... but of course you don’t even know who you-know-who is!” he had gazed hopelessly at the prime minister for a moment then said “well sit down sit down i’d better fill you in. ... have a whiskey ...” the prime minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office let alone offered his own whiskey but he sat nevertheless. fudge pulled out his wand conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air pushed one of them into the prime minister’s hand and drew up a chair. fudge had talked for more than an hour. at one point he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment which he had thrust into the prime minister’s whiskey-free hand. when at last fudge had stood up to leave the prime minister had stood up too. “so you think that ...” he had squinted down at the name in his left hand. “lord vol — ” “ he-who-must-not-be-named\” snarled fudge. “i’m sorry. ... you think that he-who-must-not-be named is still alive then?” “well dumbledore says he is,” said fudge as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin “but we’ve never found him. if you ask me he’s not dangerous unless he’s got support so it’s black we ought to be worrying about. you’ll put out that warning then excellent. well i hope we don’t see each other again prime minister! good night.” but they had seen each other again. less than a year later a harassed-looking fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the prime minister that there had been a spot of bother at the kwidditch or that was what it had sounded like world cup and that several muggles had been “involved,” but that the prime minister was not to worry the fact that you-know who’s mark had been seen again meant nothing fudge was sure it was an isolated incident and the muggle liaison office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke. “oh and i almost forgot,” fudge had added. “we’re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the triwizard tournament quite routine but the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.” “i — what — dragons?” spluttered the prime minister. “yes three,” said fudge. “and a sphinx. well good day to you.” the prime minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it but no. less than two years later fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from azkaban. “a mass breakout?” repeated the prime minister hoarsely. “no need to worry no need to worry!” shouted fudge already with one foot in the flames. “we’ll have them rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to know!” and before the prime minister could shout “now wait just one moment!” fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks. whatever the press and the opposition might say the prime minister was not a foolish man. it had not escaped his notice that despite fudge’s assurances at their first meeting they were now seeing rather a lot of each other nor that fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. little though he liked to think about the minister of magic or as he always called fudge in his head the other minister the prime minister could not help but fear that the next time fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. the sight therefore of fudge stepping out of the fire once more looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the prime minister did not know exactly why he was there was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week. “how should i know what’s going on in the — er — wizarding community?” snapped the prime minister now. “i have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without — ” “we have the same concerns,” fudge interrupted. “the brockdale bridge didn’t wear out. that wasn’t really a hurricane. those murders were not the work of muggles. and herbert chorley’s family would be safer without him. we are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to st. mungo’s hospital for magical maladies and injuries. the move should be effected tonight.” “what do you ... i’m afraid i ... what?” blustered the prime minister. fudge took a great deep breath and said “prime minister i am very sorry to have to tell you that he’s back. he-who-must-not-be-named is back.” “back when you say ‘back’ ... he’s alive i mean — ” the prime minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously when fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier. “yes alive,” said fudge. “that is — i don’t know — is a man alive if he can’t be killed i don’t really understand it and dumbledore won’t explain properly — but anyway he’s certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing so i suppose for the purposes of our discussion yes he’s alive.” the prime minister did not know what to say to this but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations. “is serious black with — er — he-who-must-not-be named?” “black black?” said fudge distractedly turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. “sirius black you mean merlin’s beard no. black’s dead. turns out we were — er — mistaken about black. he was innocent after all. and he wasn’t in league with he-who-must not-be-named either. i mean,” he added defensively spinning the bowler hat still faster “all the evidence pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but anyway as i say he’s dead. murdered as a matter of fact. on ministry of magic premises. there’s going to be an inquiry actually. ...” to his great surprise the prime minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for fudge at this point. it was however eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge. ... not yet anyway ... while the prime minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk fudge continued “but black’s by the-by now. the point is we’re at war prime minister and steps must be taken.” “at war?” repeated the prime minister nervously. “surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?” “he-who-must-not-be-named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of azkaban in january,” said fudge speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur. “since they have moved into the open they have been wreaking havoc. the brockdale bridge — he did it prime minister he threatened a mass muggle killing unless i stood aside for him and “good grief so it’s your fault those people were killed and i’m having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and i don’t know what else!” said the prime minister furiously. “my fault!” said fudge coloring up. “are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?” “maybe not,” said the prime minister standing up and striding about the room “but i would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!” “do you really think i wasn’t already making every effort?” demanded fudge heatedly. “every auror in the ministry was — and is — trying to find him and round up his followers but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!” “so i suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the west country too?” said the prime minister his temper rising with every pace he took. it was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public almost worse than it being the government’s fault after all. “that was no hurricane,” said fudge miserably. “excuse me!” barked the prime minister now positively stamping up and down. “trees uprooted roofs ripped off lampposts bent horrible injuries — ” “it was the death eaters,” said fudge. “he-who-must not-be-named’s followers. and ... and we suspect giant involvement.” the prime minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. “ what involvement?” fudge grimaced. “he used giants last time when he wanted to go for the grand effect,” he said. “the office of misinformation has been working around the clock we’ve had teams of obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the muggles who saw what really happened we’ve got most of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures running around somerset but we can’t find the giant — it’s been a disaster.” “you don’t say!” said the prime minister furiously. “i won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the ministry,” said fudge. “what with all that and then losing amelia bones.” “losing who?” “amelia bones. head of the department of magical law enforcement. we think he-who-must-not-be named may have murdered her in person because she was a very gifted witch and — and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.” fudge cleared his throat and with an effort it seemed stopped spinning his bowler hat. “but that murder was in the newspapers,” said the prime minister momentarily diverted from his anger. “our newspapers. amelia bones ... it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. it was a — a nasty killing wasn’t it it’s had rather a lot of publicity. the police are baffled you see.” fudge sighed. “well of course they are,” he said. “killed in a room that was locked from the inside wasn’t she we on the other hand know exactly who did it not that that gets us any further toward catching him. and then there was emmeline vance maybe you didn’t hear about that one — ” “oh yes i did!” said the prime minister. “it happened just around the corner from here as a matter of fact. the papers had a field day with it ‘breakdown of law and order in the prime minister’s backyard — ’ ” “and as if all that wasn’t enough,” said fudge barely listening to the prime minister “we’ve got dementors swarming all over the place attacking people left right and center. ...” once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the prime minister but he was wiser now. “i thought dementors guard the prisoners in azkaban,” he said cautiously. “they did,” said fudge wearily. “but not anymore. they’ve deserted the prison and joined he-who-must not-be-named. i won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.” “but,” said the prime minister with a sense of dawning horror “didn’t you tell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?” “that’s right. and they’re breeding. that’s what’s causing all this mist.” the prime minister sank weak-kneed into the nearest chair. the idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters made him feel quite faint. “now see here fudge — you’ve got to do something! it’s your responsibility as minister of magic!” “my dear prime minister you can’t honestly think i’m still minister of magic after all this i was sacked three days ago! the whole wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. i’ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!” said fudge with a brave attempt at a smile. the prime minister was momentarily lost for words. despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed he still rather felt for the shrunken looking man sitting opposite him. “i’m very sorry,” he said finally. “if there’s anything i can do?” “it’s very kind of you prime minister but there is nothing. i was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. i rather thought he’d be here by now but of course he’s very busy at the moment with so much going on.” fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. catching fudge’s eye the portrait said “he’ll be here in a moment he’s just finishing a letter to dumbledore.” “i wish him luck,” said fudge sounding bitter for the first time. “i’ve been writing to dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight but he won’t budge. if he’d just been prepared to persuade the boy i might still be ... well maybe scrimgeour will have more success.” fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait which suddenly spoke in its crisp official voice. “to the prime minister of muggles. requesting a meeting. urgent. kindly respond immediately. rufus scrimgeour minister of magic.” “yes yes fine,” said the prime minister distractedly and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again rose up and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug. fudge got to his feet and after a moment’s hesitation the prime minister did the same watching the new arrival straighten up dust down his long black robes and look around. the prime minister’s first foolish thought was that rufus scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. there were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. there was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness the prime minister thought he understood why the wizarding community preferred scrimgeour to fudge as a leader in these dangerous times. “how do you do?” said the prime minister politely holding out his hand. scrimgeour grasped it briefly his eyes scanning the room then pulled out a wand from under his robes. “fudge told you everything?” he asked striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. the prime minister heard the lock click. “er — yes,” said the prime minister. “and if you don’t mind i’d rather that door remained unlocked.” “i’d rather not be interrupted,” said scrimgeour shortly “or watched,” he added pointing his wand at the windows so that the curtains swept across them. “right well i’m a busy man so let’s get down to business. first of all we need to discuss your security.” the prime minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied “i am perfectly happy with the security i’ve already got thank you very — ” “well we’re not,” scrimgeour cut in. “it’ll be a poor lookout for the muggles if their prime minister gets put under the imperius curse. the new secretary in your outer office — ” ‘tm not getting rid of kingsley shacklebolt if that’s what you’re suggesting!” said the prime minister hotly. “he’s highly efficient gets through twice the work the rest of them — ” “that’s because he’s a wizard,” said scrimgeour without a flicker of a smile. “a highly trained auror who has been assigned to you for your protection.” “now wait a moment!” declared the prime minister. “you can’t just put your people into my office i decide who works for me — ” “i thought you were happy with shacklebolt?” said scrimgeour coldly. “i am — that’s to say i was — ” “then there’s no problem is there?” said scrimgeour. “i ... well as long as shacklebolt’s work continues to be ... er ... excellent,” said the prime minister lamely but scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him. “now about herbert chorley your junior minister,” he continued. “the one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.” “what about him?” asked the prime minister. “he has clearly reacted to a poorly performed imperius curse,” said scrimgeour. “it’s addled his brains but he could still be dangerous.” “he’s only quacking!” said the prime minister weakly. “surely a bit of a rest . . . maybe go easy on the drink “a team of healers from st. mungo’s hospital for magical maladies and injuries are examining him as we speak. so far he has attempted to strangle three of them,” said scrimgeour. “i think it best that we remove him from muggle society for a while.” “i ... well ... he’ll be all right won’t he?” said the prime minister anxiously. scrimgeour merely shrugged already moving back toward the fireplace. “well that’s really all i had to say. i will keep you posted of developments prime minister — or at least i shall probably be too busy to come personally in which case i shall send fudge here. he has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.” fudge attempted to smile but was unsuccessful he merely looked as though he had a toothache. scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. the prime minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last. “but for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards'. you can do magic ! surely you can sort out — well — anything !” scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with fudge who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly “the trouble is the other side can do magic too prime minister.” and with that the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished. spinner’s end many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime minister’s windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown rubbish strewn banks. an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous. there was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass. but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. the figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass. with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized. “wait!” the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead. the second figure turned over the animal with its toe. “just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from under the hood. “i thought perhaps an auror — cissy wait!” but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down. “cissy — narcissa — listen to me — ” the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away. “go back bella!” “you must listen to me!” “i’ve listened already. i’ve made my decision. leave me alone!” the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street. the other woman bella followed at once. side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness. “he lives here?” asked bella in a voice of contempt. “here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot — ” but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road. “cissy wait\” bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street. some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other. “cissy you must not do this you can’t trust him — ” “the dark lord trusts him doesn’t he?” “the dark lord is ... i believe ... mistaken,” bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. “in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. this is a betrayal of the dark lord’s — ” “let go bella!” snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the other’s face. bella merely laughed. “cissy your own sister you wouldn’t — ” “there is nothing i wouldn’t do anymore!” narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light. bella let go of her sister’s arm as though burned. “narcisscd” but narcissa had rushed ahead. rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. at last narcissa hurried up a street named spinner’s end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room. she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up. together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes. narcissa threw back her hood. she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person. “narcissa!” said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. “what a pleasant surprise!” “severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “may i speak to you it’s urgent.” “but of course.” he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. her still-hooded sister followed without invitation. “snape,” she said curtly as she passed him. “bellatrix,” he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them. they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell. the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited. snape gestured narcissa to the sofa. she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa. “so what can i do for you?” snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters. “we ... we are alone aren’t we?” narcissa asked quietly. “yes of course. well wormtail’s here but we’re not counting vermin are we?” he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen. “as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests,” said snape lazily. the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room. he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper. his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove. “narcissa!” he said in a squeaky voice. “and bellatrix! how charming — ” “wormtail will get us drinks if you’d like them,” said snape. “and then he will return to his bedroom.” wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him. “i am not your servant!” he squeaked avoiding snape ’s eye. “really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me.” “to assist yes — but not to make you drinks and — and clean your house!” “i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments,” said snape silkily. “this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord — ” “i can speak to him myself if i want to!” “of course you can,” said snape sneering. “but in the meantime bring us drinks. some of the elf-made wine will do.” wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. they heard banging and a clinking of glasses. within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the book-covered door behind him. snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape. this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused. “the dark lord,” he said raising his glass and draining it. the sisters copied him. snape refilled their glasses. as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush “severus i’m sorry to come here like this but i had to see you. i think you are the only one who can help me snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs. “my apologies,” said snape. “he has lately taken to listening at doors i don’t know what he means by it. ... you were saying narcissa?” she took a great shuddering breath and started again. “severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but — ” “then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled bellatrix. “particularly in present company!” “ ‘present company’?” repeated snape sardonically. “and what am i to understand by that bellatrix?” “that i don’t trust you snape as you very well know!” narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into bellatrix’s glowering face. “narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions. well continue bellatrix,” said snape. “why is it that you do not trust me?” “a hundred reasons!” she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. “where to start! where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that you’ve lived in dumbledore’s pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the sorcerer’s stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years?” she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks. behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands. snape smiled. “before i answer you — oh yes bellatrix i am going to answer! you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord! before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn. do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you?” she hesitated. “i know he believes you but ...” “you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen?” bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited. snape did not press the point. he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued “you ask where i was when the dark lord fell. i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore. you know i presume that it was on the dark lord’s orders that i took up the post?” she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her. “you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished. for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius” — he inclined his head slightly to narcissa — “and many others did not attempt to find him. i believed him finished. i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is. ... if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left.” “he’d have me!” said bellatrix passionately. “i who spent many years in azkaban for him!” “yes indeed most admirable,” said snape in a bored voice. “of course you weren’t a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine — ” “gesture!” she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad. “while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing dumbledore’s pet!” “not quite,” said snape calmly. “he wouldn’t give me the defense against the dark arts job you know. seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse . . . tempt me into my old ways.” “this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject?” she jeered. “why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead?” “hardly,” said snape “although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen years of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant azkaban is. ...” “but you stayed — ” “yes bellatrix i stayed,” said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. “i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban. they were rounding up the death eaters you know. dumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and i used it. i repeat the dark lord does not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do. “i think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting “why i stood between the dark lord and the sorcerer’s stone. that is easily answered. he did not know whether he could trust me. he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to dumbledore’s stooge. he was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry. i deeply regret that he did not trust me. he would have returned to power three years sooner. as it was i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him.” bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine. “but you didn’t return when he came back you didn’t fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn — ” “correct. i returned two hours later. i returned on dumbledore’s orders.” “on dumbledore’s — ” she began in tones of outrage. “think!” said snape impatient again. “think! by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy! by allowing dumbledore to think that i was only returning to the dark lord’s side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since! consider bellatrix the dark mark had been growing stronger for months. i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew! i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff didn’t i “the dark lord’s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely i assure you when i explained that i remained faithful although dumbledore thought i was his man. yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he was wrong.” “but what use have you been?” sneered bellatrix. “what useful information have we had from you?” “my information has been conveyed directly to the dark lord,” said snape. “if he chooses not to share it with you — ” “he shares everything with me!” said bellatrix firing up at once. “he calls me his most loyal his most faithful — ” “does he?” said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. “does he still after the fiasco at the ministry?” “that was not my fault!” said bellatrix flushing. “the dark lord has in the past entrusted me with his most precious — if lucius hadn’t — ” “don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my husband!” said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister. “there is no point apportioning blame,” said snape smoothly. “what is done is done.” “but not by you!” said bellatrix furiously. “no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not snape?” “my orders were to remain behind,” said snape. “perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined forces with the death eaters to fight the order of the phoenix and — forgive me — you speak of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers were you not?” “they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long!” snarled bellatrix. “and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters don’t you?” “i am not the secret-keeper i cannot speak the name of the place. you understand how the enchantment works i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order. it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off.” he inclined his head and toasted her. her expression did not soften. “you are avoiding my last question snape. harry potter. you could have killed him at any point in the past five years. you have not done it. why?” “have you discussed this matter with the dark lord?” asked snape. “he ... lately we ... i am asking you snape!” “if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible — ” “you claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she jeered. “i do not claim it i had no idea of his plans i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead. i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago. ...” “but why did you keep him alive?” “have you not understood me it was only dumbledore’s protection that was keeping me out of azkaban! do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there was more to it than that. i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great dark wizard which was how he had survived the dark lord’s attack. indeed many of the dark lord’s old followers thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. i was curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle. “of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. he has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand.” “and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore has never suspected you?” asked bellatrix. “he has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still?” “i have played my part well,” said snape. “and you overlook dumbledore’s greatest weakness he has to believe the best of people. i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater days and he embraced me with open arms — though as i say never allowing me nearer the dark arts than he could help. dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh yes he has,” for bellatrix had made a scathing noise “the dark lord acknowledges it. i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old. the duel with the dark lord last month shook him. he has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. but through all these years he has never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lies my great value to the dark lord.” bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next. taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister. “now ... you came to ask me for help narcissa?” narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair. “yes severus. i — i think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn. lucius is in jail and ...” she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids. “the dark lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” narcissa continued her eyes still closed. “he wishes none to know of the plan. it is ... very secret. but — ” “if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak,” said snape at once. “the dark lord’s word is law.” narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house. “there!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence!” but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk. he turned around to face narcissa frowning. “it so happens that i know of the plan,” he said in a low voice. “i am one of the few the dark lord has told. nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord.” “i thought you must know about it!” said narcissa breathing more freely. “he trusts you so severus. ...” “you know about the plan?” said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. “ you know?” “certainly,” said snape. “but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all.” “severus,” she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks. “my son ... my only son ...” “draco should be proud,” said bellatrix indifferently. “the dark lord is granting him a great honor. and i will say this for draco he isn’t shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect — ” narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape. “that’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! why severus why my son it is too dangerous! this is vengeance for lucius’s mistake i know it!” snape said nothing. he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her. “that’s why he’s chosen draco isn’t it?” she persisted. “to punish lucius?” “if draco succeeds,” said snape still looking away from her “he will be honored above all others.” “but he won’t succeed!” sobbed narcissa. “how can he when the dark lord himself — ” bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve. “i only meant ... that nobody has yet succeeded. ... severus ... please ... you are you have always been draco’s favorite teacher. ... you are lucius’s old friend. ... i beg you. ... you are the dark lord’s favorite his most trusted advisor. ... will you speak to him persuade him — ” “the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it,” said snape flatly. “i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius. lucius was supposed to be in charge. he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed.” “then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge!” choked narcissa. “he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying!” when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed. standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes. her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped “you could do it. you could do it instead of draco severus. you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us — ” snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. looking down into her tears tained face he said slowly “he intends me to do it in the end i think. but he is determined that draco should try first. you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy.” “in other words it doesn’t matter to him if draco is killed!” “the dark lord is very angry,” repeated snape quietly. “he failed to hear the prophecy. you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily.” she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor. “my only son ... my only son ...” “you should be proud!” said bellatrix ruthlessly. “if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord!” narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa. he then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand. “narcissa that’s enough. drink this. listen to me.” she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip. “it might be possible ... for me to help draco.” she sat up her face paper-white her eyes huge. “severus — oh severus — you would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm?” “i can try.” she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at snape ’s feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it. “if you are there to protect him ... severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow?” “the unbreakable vow?” snape’s expression was blank unreadable. bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter. “aren’t you listening narcissa oh he’ll try i’m sure. ... the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action ... oh on the dark lord’s orders of course!” snape did not look at bellatrix. his black eyes were fixed upon narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand. “certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow,” he said quietly. “perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder.” bellatrix’s mouth fell open. snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa. beneath bellatrix’s astonished gaze they grasped right hands. “you will need your wand bellatrix,” said snape coldly. she drew it still looking astonished. “and you will need to move a little closer,” he said. she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands. narcissa spoke. “will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts to fulfill the dark lord’s wishes?” “i will,” said snape. a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire. “and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm?” “i will,” said snape. a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain. “and should it prove necessary ... if it seems draco will fail ...” whispered narcissa snape’s hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away “will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform?” there was a moment’s silence. bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide. “i will,” said snape. bellatrix’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a rope like a fiery snake. 3 will and won’t harry potter was snoring loudly. he had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours staring out at the darkening street and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. the misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair. the room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. owl feathers apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled robes on his bed and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk. the headline of one blared harry potter the chosen one rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the ministry of magic during which he-who-must-not-be-named was sighted once more. “we’re not allowed to talk about it don’t ask me anything,” said one agitated obliviator who refused to give his name as he left the ministry last night. nevertheless highly placed sources within the ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled hall of prophecy. though ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the wizarding community believe that the death eaters now serving sentences in azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. the nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concerns harry potter the only person ever known to have survived the killing curse and who is also known to have been at the ministry on the night in question. some are going so far as to call potter “the chosen one,” believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of he who-must-not-be-named. the current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although ctd. page 2 column 5 a second newspaper lay beside the first. this one bore the headline scrimgeour succeeds fudge most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. the picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling. rufus scrimgeour previously head of the auror office in the department of magical law enforcement has succeeded cornelius fudge as minister of magic. the appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the wizarding community though rumors of a rift between the new minister and albus dumbledore newly reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot surfaced within hours of scrimgeour taking office. scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he had met with dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topics under discussion. albus dumbledore is known to ctd. page 3 column 2 to the left of this paper sat another which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students’ safety was visible. newly appointed minister of magic rufus scrimgeour spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this autumn. “for obvious reasons the ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans,” said the minister although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms a complex array of countercurses and a small task force of aurors dedicated solely to the protection of hogwarts school. most seem reassured by the new minister’s tough stand on student safety. said mrs. augusta longbottom “my grandson neville — a good friend of harry potter’s incidentally who fought the death eaters alongside him at the ministry in june and — but the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it. inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but harry was too deeply asleep to hear her. a large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. its lid was open it looked expectant yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweets empty ink bottles and broken quills that coated the very bottom. nearby on the floor lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words — issued on behalf of — the ministry of magic protecting your home and family against dark forces the wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the death eaters. observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you your family and your home from attack. 1. you are advised not to leave the house alone. 2. particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. wherever possible arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen. 3. review the security arrangements around your house making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as shield and disillusionment charms and in the case of underage family members side-along-apparition. 4. agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect death eaters masquerading as others by use of the polyjuice potion see page 2). 5. should you feel that a family member colleague friend or neighbor is acting in a strange manner contact the magical law enforcement squad at once. they may have been put under the imperius curse see page 4). 6. should the dark mark appear over any dwelling place or other building do not enter but contact the auror office immediately. 7. unconfirmed sightings suggest that the death eaters may now be using inferi see page 10). any sighting of an inferius or encounter with same should be reported to the ministry immediately. harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up. an alarm clock repaired by harry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven. beside it held in place by harry’s relaxed hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing. harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat. dear harry if it is convenient to you i shall call at number four privet drive this coming friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays. if you are agreeable i should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which i hope to attend on the way to the burrow. i shall explain this more fully when i see you. kindly send your answer by return of this owl. hoping to see you this friday i am yours most sincerely albus dumbledore though he already knew it by heart harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o’clock that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of privet drive. he knew it was pointless to keep rereading dumbledore ’s words harry had sent back his “yes” with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait either dumbledore was going to come or he was not. but harry had not packed. it just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. he could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong — his reply to dumbledore ’s letter might have gone astray dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap. harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl hedwig safely in her cage. the minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the streetlamp outside the window went out. harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. a tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path. harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. even as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of crisps across the room the doorbell rang. downstairs in the living room his uncle vernon shouted “who the blazes is calling at this time of night?” harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. he had completely forgotten to warn the dursleys that dumbledore might be coming. feeling both panicky and close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say “good evening. you must be mr. dursley. i daresay harry has told you i would be coming for him?” harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible. there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. half-moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat. vernon dursley whose mustache was quite as bushy as dumbledore ’s though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes. “judging by your look of stunned disbelief harry did not warn you that i was coming,” said dumbledore pleasantly. “however let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. it is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.” he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him. “it is a long time since my last visit,” said dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at uncle vernon. “i must say your agapanthus are flourishing.” vernon dursley said nothing at all. harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soon — the vein pulsing in his uncle’s temple was reaching danger point — but something about dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. it might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even uncle vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully. “ah good evening harry,” said dumbledore looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. “excellent excellent.” these words seemed to rouse uncle vernon. it was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at harry and say “excellent” was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye. “i don’t mean to be rude — ” he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable. “ — yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,” dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. “best to say nothing at all my dear man. ah and this must be petunia.” the kitchen door had opened and there stood harry’s aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual pre bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock. “albus dumbledore,” said dumbledore when uncle vernon failed to effect an introduction. “we have corresponded of course.” harry thought this an odd way of reminding aunt petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but aunt petunia did not challenge the term. “and this must be your son dudley?” dudley had that moment peered round the living room door. his large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear. dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the dursleys were going to say anything but as the silence stretched on he smiled. “shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room dudley scrambled out of the way as dumbledore passed him. harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest. he looked quite extraordinarily out of place. “aren’t — aren’t we leaving sir?” harry asked anxiously. “yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,” said dumbledore. “and i would prefer not to do so in the open. we shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little longer.” “you will will you?” vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both. “yes,” said dumbledore simply “i shall.” he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the dursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position. “we may as well be comfortable,” said dumbledore pleasantly. as he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. “sir — what happened to your — ” “later harry,” said dumbledore. “please sit down.” harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence. “i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,” dumbledore said to uncle vernon “but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.” a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room. “madam rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped. he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely. the dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore was rather enjoying himself. “well harry,” said dumbledore turning toward him “a difficulty has arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for us. by us i mean the order of the phoenix. but first of all i must tell you that sirius’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.” over on the sofa uncle vernon’s head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except “oh. right.” “this is in the main fairly straightforward,” dumbledore went on. “you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of sirius’s personal possessions. the slightly problematic part of the legacy — ” “his godfather’s dead?” said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa. dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him. the glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of vernon’s head he attempted to beat it away. “he’s dead his godfather?” “yes,” said dumbledore. he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys. “our problem,” he continued to harry as if there had been no interruption “is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place.” “he’s been left a house?” said uncle vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him. “you can keep using it as headquarters,” said harry. “i don’t care. you can have it i don’t really want it.” harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it. he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave. “that is generous,” said dumbledore. “we have however vacated the building temporarily.” “why?” “well,” said dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of uncle vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead “black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of ‘black. ’ sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless. while his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.” a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of sirius’s mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into harry’s mind. “i bet there has,” he said. “quite,” said dumbledore. “and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of sirius’s living relatives which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange.” without realizing what he was doing harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. bellatrix lestrange sirius’s killer inherit his house “no,” he said. “well obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it either,” said dumbledore calmly. “the situation is fraught with complications. we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from sirius’s hands. it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position.” “but how are you going to find out if i’m allowed to own it?” “fortunately,” said dumbledore “there is a simple test.” he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle vernon shouted “ will you get these ruddy things off us?” harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere. “oh i’m so sorry,” said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again. all three glasses vanished. “but it would have been better manners to drink it you know.” it looked as though uncle vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on dumbledore ’s wand. “you see,” dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking as though uncle vernon had not uttered “if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited — ” he flicked his wand for a fifth time. there was a loud crack and a house-elf appeared with a snout for a nose giant bat’s ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the dursleys’ shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. aunt petunia let out a hair-raising shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and uncle vernon bellowed “what the hell is that?” “kreacher,” finished dumbledore. “kreacher won’t kreacher won’t kreacher won’t!” croaked the house-elf quite as loudly as uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears. “kreacher belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the blacks kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher won’t go to the potter brat kreacher won’t won’t won’t — ” “as you can see harry,” said dumbledore loudly over kreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t won’t won’t,” “kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.” “i don’t care,” said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping house-elf. “i don’t want him.” “won’t won’t won’t won’t — ” “you would prefer him to pass into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year?” “won’t won’t won’t won’t — ” harry stared at dumbledore. he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius was repugnant. “give him an order,” said dumbledore. “if he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey. if not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.” “won’t won’t won’t won’t.” kreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. harry could think of nothing to say except “kreacher shut up!” it looked for a moment as though kreacher was going to choke. he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging. after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum. “well that simplifies matters,” said dumbledore cheerfully. “it seems that sirius knew what he was doing. you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher.” “do i — do i have to keep him with me?” harry asked aghast as kreacher thrashed around at his feet. “not if you don’t want to,” said dumbledore. “if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. in that way the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.” “yeah,” said harry in relief “yeah i’ll do that. er — kreacher — i want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves.” kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished. “good,” said dumbledore. “there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak. hagrid has been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements — ” “no,” said harry at once “he can stay with hagrid. i think buckbeak would prefer that.” “hagrid will be delighted,” said dumbledore smiling. “he was thrilled to see buckbeak again. incidentally we have decided in the interests of buckbeak’s safety to rechristen him ‘witherwings’ for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. now harry is your trunk packed?” “erm ...” “doubtful that i would turn up?” dumbledore suggested shrewdly. “i’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers. it took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding hedwig’s cage in the other he made his way back downstairs. he was disappointed to discover that dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room. nobody was talking. dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys as he said “professor — i’m ready now.” “good,” said dumbledore. “just one last thing then.” and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more. “as you will no doubt be aware harry comes of age in a year’s time — ” “no,” said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since dumbledore’s arrival. “i’m sorry?” said dumbledore politely. “no he doesn’t. he’s a month younger than dudley and dudders doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after next.” “ah,” said dumbledore pleasantly “but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen.” uncle vernon muttered “preposterous,” but dumbledore ignored him. “now as you already know the wizard called lord voldemort has returned to this country. the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. harry whom lord voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own.” dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together. “you did not do as i asked. you have never treated harry as a son. he has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. the best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.” both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them. “us — mistreat dudders what d’you — ” began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his finger for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle vernon dumb. “the magic i evoked fifteen years ago means that harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘home.’ however miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom. this magic will cease to operate the moment that harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man. i ask only this that you allow harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.” none of the dursleys said anything. dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. uncle vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat aunt petunia however was oddly flushed. “well harry ... time for us to be off,” said dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak. “until we meet again,” he said to the dursleys who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room. “bye,” said harry hastily to the dursleys and followed dumbledore who paused beside harry’s trunk upon which hedwig’s cage was perched. “we do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” he said pulling out his wand again. “i shall send them to the burrow to await us there. however i would like you to bring your invisibility cloak ... just in case.” harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show dumbledore the mess within. when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk cage and hedwig vanished. dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness. “and now harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure.” horace slughorn despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down privet drive together. he had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of hogwarts before there was usually a desk between them. the memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened harry’s sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of dumbledore ’s most prized possessions. dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed. “keep your wand at the ready harry,” he said brightly. “but i thought i’m not allowed to use magic outside school sir?” “if there is an attack,” said dumbledore “i give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. however i do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.” “why not sir?” “you are with me,” said dumbledore simply. “this will do harry.” he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive. “you have not of course passed your apparition test,” he said. “no,” said harry. “i thought you had to be seventeen?” “you do,” said dumbledore. “so you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. my left if you don’t mind — as you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.” harry gripped dumbledore’s proffered forearm. “very good,” said dumbledore. “well here we go.” harry felt dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tightening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then — he gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. he felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. it was a few seconds before he realized that privet drive had vanished. he and dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. his comprehension catching up with his senses harry realized that he had just apparated for the first time in his life. “are you all right?” asked dumbledore looking down at him solicitously. “the sensation does take some getting used to.” “i’m fine,” said harry rubbing his ears which felt as though they had left privet drive rather reluctantly. “but i think i might prefer brooms. ...” dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more tightly around his neck and said “this way.” he set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses. according to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight. “so tell me harry,” said dumbledore. “your scar ... has it been hurting at all?” harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark. “no,” he said “and ive been wondering about that. i thought it would be burning all the time now voldemort’s getting so powerful again.” he glanced up at dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression. “i on the other hand thought otherwise,” said dumbledore. “lord voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. it appears that he is now employing occlumency against you.” “well i’m not complaining,” said harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into voldemort’s mind. they turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. harry looked sideways at dumbledore again. “professor?” “harry?” “er — where exactly are we?” “this harry is the charming village of budleigh babberton.” “and what are we doing here?” “ah yes of course i haven’t told you,” said dumbledore. “well i have lost count of the number of times i have said this in recent years but we are once again one member of staff short. we are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to hogwarts.” “how can i help with that sir?” “oh i think we’ll find a use for you,” said dumbledore vaguely. “left here harry.” they proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses. all the windows were dark. the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two weeks persisted here too. thinking of dementors harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket. “professor why couldn’t we just apparate directly into your old colleague’s house?” “because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door,” said dumbledore. “courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. in any case most wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted apparators. at hogwarts for instance — ” “ — you can’t apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,” said harry quickly. “hermione granger told me.” “and she is quite right. we turn left again.” the church clock chimed midnight behind them. harry wondered why dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask. “sir i saw in the daily prophet that fudge has been sacked. ...” “correct,” said dumbledore now turning up a steep side street. “he has been replaced as i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office.” “is he ... do you think he’s good?” asked harry. “an interesting question,” said dumbledore. “he is able certainly. a more decisive and forceful personality than cornelius.” “yes but i meant — ” “i know what you meant. rufus is a man of action and having fought dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate lord voldemort.” harry waited but dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with scrimgeour that the daily prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed it. “and ... sir ... i saw about madam bones.” “yes,” said dumbledore quietly. “a terrible loss. she was a great witch. just up here i think — ouch.” he had pointed with his injured hand. “professor what happened to your — ” “i have no time to explain now,” said dumbledore. “it is a thrilling tale i wish to do it justice.” he smiled at harry who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions. “sir — i got a ministry of magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take against the death eaters. ...” “yes i received one myself,” said dumbledore still smiling. “did you find it useful?” “not really.” “no i thought not. you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor dumbledore and not an impostor.” “i didn’t ...” harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not. “for future reference harry it is raspberry ... although of course if i were a death eater i would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.” “er ... right,” said harry. “well on that leaflet it said something about inferi. what exactly are they the leaflet wasn’t very clear.” “they are corpses,” said dumbledore calmly. “dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a dark wizard’s bidding. inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since voldemort was last powerful. . . . he killed enough people to make an army of them of course. this is the place harry just here. ...” they were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden. harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate dumbledore stopped dead and harry walked into him. “oh dear. oh dear dear dear.” harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. the front door was hanging off its hinges. dumbledore glanced up and down the street. it seemed quite deserted. “wand out and follow me harry,” he said quietly. he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready. “lumos.” dumbledore ’s wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway. to the left another door stood open. holding his illuminated wand aloft dumbledore walked into the sitting room with harry right behind him. a scene of total devastation met their eyes. a grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. a piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor. the wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby. cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. harry’s small intake of breath made dumbledore look around. “not pretty is it?” he said heavily. “yes something horrible has happened here.” dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. harry followed gazing around half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body. “maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off professor?” harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls. “i don’t think so,” said dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side. “you mean he’s — ” “still here somewhere yes.” and without warning dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled “ouch!” “good evening horace,” said dumbledore straightening up again. harry’s jaw dropped. where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye. “there was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” he said gruffly clambering to his feet. “it hurt.” the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas. the top of his head barely reached dumbledore ’s chin. “what gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly. he seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair. “my dear horace,” said dumbledore looking amused “if the death eaters really had come to call the dark mark would have been set over the house.” the wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead. “the dark mark,” he muttered. “knew there was something ... ah well. wouldn’t have had time anyway i’d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.” he heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter. “would you like my assistance clearing up?” asked dumbledore politely. “please,” said the other. they stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion. the furniture flew back to its original places ornaments reformed in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean. “what kind of blood was that incidentally?” asked dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock. “on the walls dragon,” shouted the wizard called horace as with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling. there was a final plunk from the piano and silence. “yes dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. “my last bottle and prices are sky-high at the moment. still it might be reusable.” he stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within. “hmm. bit dusty.” he set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. it was then that his gaze fell upon harry. “oho,” he said his large round eyes flying to harry’s forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. “ohol” “this,” said dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction “is harry potter. harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine horace slughorn.” slughorn turned on dumbledore his expression shrewd. “so that’s how you thought you’d persuade me is it well the answer’s no albus.” he pushed past harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation. “i suppose we can have a drink at least?” asked dumbledore. “for old time’s sake?” slughorn hesitated. “all right then one drink,” he said ungraciously. dumbledore smiled at harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. harry took the seat with the distinct impression that dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible. certainly when slughorn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon harry. “hmpf,” he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. “here — ” he gave a drink to dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. his legs were so short they did not touch the floor. “well how have you been keeping horace?” dumbledore asked. “not so well,” said slughorn at once. “weak chest. wheezy. rheumatism too. can’t move like i used to. well that’s to be expected. old age. fatigue.” “and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,” said dumbledore. “you can’t have had more than three minutes’ warning?” slughorn said half irritably half proudly “two. didn’t hear my intruder charm go off i was taking a bath. still,” he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again “the fact remains that i’m an old man albus. a tired old man who’s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.” he certainly had those thought harry looking around the room. it was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft chairs and footstools drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. if harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady. “you’re not yet as old as i am horace,” said dumbledore. “well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,” said slughorn bluntly. his pale gooseberry eyes had found dumbledore ’s injured hand. “reactions not what they were i see.” “you’re quite right,” said dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers the sight of them made the back of harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly. “i am undoubtedly slower than i was. but on the other hand ...” he shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen dumbledore wear before it was large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. slughorn’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too and harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead. “so all these precautions against intruders horace ... are they for the death eaters’ benefit or mine?” asked dumbledore. “what would the death eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?” demanded slughorn. “i imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder,” said dumbledore. “are you really telling me that they haven’t come recruiting yet?” slughorn eyed dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered “i haven’t given them the chance. i’ve been on the move for a year. never stay in one place more than a week. move from muggle house to muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the canary islands — it’s been very pleasant i’ll be sorry to leave. it’s quite easy once you know how one simple freezing charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’t spot you bringing in the piano.” “ingenious,” said dumbledore. “but it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. now if you were to return to hogwarts — ” “if you’re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath albus! i might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since dolores umbridge left! if that’s how you treat teachers these days — ” “professor umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” said dumbledore. “i think you horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ” “that’s what she did did she?” said slughorn. “idiotic woman. never liked her.” harry chuckled and both dumbledore and slughorn looked round at him. “sorry,” harry said hastily. “it’s just — i didn’t like her either.” dumbledore stood up rather suddenly. “are you leaving?” asked slughorn at once looking hopeful. “no i was wondering whether i might use your bathroom,” said dumbledore. “oh,” said slughorn clearly disappointed. “second on the left down the hall.” dumbledore strode from the room. once the door had closed behind him there was silence. after a few moments slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. he shot a furtive look at harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind. “don’t think i don’t know why he’s brought you,” he said abruptly. harry merely looked at slughorn. slughorn ’s watery eyes slid over harry’s scar this time taking in the rest of his face. “you look very like your father.” “yeah i’ve been told,” said harry. “except for your eyes. you’ve got — ” “my mother’s eyes yeah.” harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing. “hmpf. yes well. you shouldn’t have favorites as a teacher of course but she was one of mine. your mother,” slughorn added in answer to harry’s questioning look. “lily evans. one of the brightest i ever taught. vivacious you know. charming girl. i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house. very cheeky answers i used to get back too.” “which was your house?” “i was head of slytherin,” said slughorn. “oh now,” he went on quickly seeing the expression on harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him “don’t go holding that against me! you’ll be gryffindor like her i suppose yes it usually goes in families. not always though. ever heard of sirius black you must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks ago — ” it was as though an invisible hand had twisted harry’s intestines and held them tight. “well anyway he was a big pal of your father’s at school. the whole black family had been in my house but sirius ended up in gryffindor! shame — he was a talented boy. i got his brother regulus when he came along but i’d have liked the set.” he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. apparently lost in memories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside. “your mother was muggle-born of course. couldn’t believe it when i found out. thought she must have been pure-blood she was so good.” “one of my best friends is muggle-born,” said harry “and she’s the best in our year.” “funny how that sometimes happens isn’t it?” said slughorn. “not really,” said harry coldly. slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “you mustn’t think i’m prejudiced!” he said. “no no no! haven’t i just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students and there was dirk cresswell in the year after her too — now head of the goblin liaison office of course — another muggle-born a very gifted student and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at gringotts!” he bounced up and down a little smiling in a self satisfied way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants. “all ex-students all signed. you’ll notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet he’s always interested to hear my take on the day’s news. and ambrosius flume of honeydukes — a hamper every birthday and all because i was able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkiss who gave him his first job! and at the back — you’ll see her if you just crane your neck — that’s gwenog jones who of course captains the holyhead harpies. ... people are always astonished to hear i’m on first-name terms with the harpies and free tickets whenever i want them!” this thought seemed to cheer him up enormously. “and all these people know where to find you to send you stuff?” asked harry who could not help wondering why the death eaters had not yet tracked down slughorn if hampers of sweets quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him. the smile slid from slughorn ’s face as quickly as the blood from his walls. “of course not,” he said looking down at harry. “i have been out of touch with everybody for a year.” harry had the impression that the words shocked slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment. then he shrugged. “still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. all very well for dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix! and while i’m sure they’re very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i don’t personally fancy the mortality rate — ” “you don’t have to join the order to teach at hogwarts,” said harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it was hard to sympathize with slughorn ’s cosseted existence when he remembered sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats. “most of the teachers aren’t in it and none of them has ever been killed — well unless you count quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with voldemort.” harry had been sure slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear voldemort’s name spoken aloud and was not disappointed slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which harry ignored. “i reckon the staff are safer than most people while dumbledore ’s headmaster he’s supposed to be the only one voldemort ever feared isn’t he?” harry went on. slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two he seemed to be thinking over harry’s words. “well yes it is true that he-who-must-not-be-named has never sought a fight with dumbledore,” he muttered grudgingly. “and i suppose one could argue that as i have not joined the death eaters he-who must-not-be-named can hardly count me a friend ... in which case i might well be safer a little closer to albus. ... i cannot pretend that amelia bones’s death did not shake me. ... if she with all her ministry contacts and protection ...” dumbledore reentered the room and slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house. “oh there you are albus,” he said. “you’ve been a very long time. upset stomach?” “no i was merely reading the muggle magazines,” said dumbledore. “i do love knitting patterns. well harry we have trespassed upon horace’s hospitality quite long enough i think it is time for us to leave.” not at all reluctant to obey harry jumped to his feet. slughorn seemed taken aback. “you’re leaving?” “yes indeed. i think i know a lost cause when i see one.” “lost... ” slughorn seemed agitated. he twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and harry zip up his jacket. “well i’m sorry you don’t want the job horace,” said dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. “hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to.” “yes ... well ... very gracious ... as i say ...” “good-bye then.” “bye,” said harry. they were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them. “all right all right 111 do it!” dumbledore turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room. “you will come out of retirement?” “yes yes,” said slughorn impatiently. “i must be mad but yes.” “wonderful,” said dumbledore beaming. “then horace we shall see you on the first of september.” “yes i daresay you will,” grunted slughorn. as they set off down the garden path slughorn ’s voice floated after them “111 want a pay rise dumbledore!” dumbledore chuckled. the garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist. “well done harry,” said dumbledore. “i didn’t do anything,” said harry in surprise. “oh yes you did. you showed horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to hogwarts. did you like him?” “er ...” harry wasn’t sure whether he liked slughorn or not. he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a muggle-born should make a good witch. “horace,” said dumbledore relieving harry of the responsibility to say any of this “likes his comfort. he also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful. he enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. he has never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseat — more room to spread out you see. he used to handpick favorites at hogwarts sometimes for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions forging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the goblin liaison office.” harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer. “i tell you all this,” dumbledore continued “not to turn you against horace — or as we must now call him professor slughorn — but to put you on your guard. he will undoubtedly try to collect you harry. you would be the jewel of his collection ‘the boy who lived’ ... or as they call you these days ‘the chosen one.’” at these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over harry. he was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him neither can live while the other survives . . . dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier. “this will do harry. if you will grasp my arm.” braced this time harry was ready for the apparition but still found it unpleasant. when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the burrow. in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. ron was in there ... and so was mrs. weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew. ... “if you don’t mind harry,” said dumbledore as they passed through the gate “i’d like a few words with you before we part. in private. perhaps in here?” dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the weasleys kept their broomsticks. a little puzzled harry followed dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard. dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at harry. “i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it harry but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the ministry. permit me to say that i think sirius would have been proud of you.” harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him. he did not think he could stand to discuss sirius it had been painful enough to hear uncle vernon say “his godfather’s dead?” and even worse to hear sirius’s name thrown out casually by slughorn. “it was cruel,” said dumbledore softly “that you and sirius had such a short time together. a brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.” harry nodded his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing dumbledore’s hat. he could tell that dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived harry had spent nearly all his time at the dursleys’ lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors. “it’s just hard,” harry said finally in a low voice “to realize he won’t write to me again.” his eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. he felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather . . . and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again. “sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,” said dumbledore gently. “naturally the loss is devastating. ...” “but while i was at the dursleys’ ...” interrupted harry his voice growing stronger “i realized i can’t shut myself away or — or crack up. sirius wouldn’t have wanted that would he and anyway life’s too short. ... look at madam bones look at emmeline vance. ... it could be me next couldn’t it but if it is,” he said fiercely now looking straight into dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight “i’ll make sure i take as many death eaters with me as i can and voldemort too if i can manage it.” “spoken both like your mother and father’s son and sirius’s true godson!” said dumbledore with an approving pat on harry’s back. “i take my hat off to you — or i would if i were not afraid of showering you in spiders. “and now harry on a closely related subject ... i gather that you have been taking the daily prophet over the last two weeks?” “yes,” said harry and his heart beat a little faster. “then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the hall of prophecy?” “yes,” said harry again. “and now everyone knows that i’m the one — ” “no they do not,” interrupted dumbledore. “there are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and lord voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed. it is true however that many have guessed correctly that voldemort sent his death eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you. “now i think i am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?” “no,” said harry. “a wise decision on the whole,” said dumbledore. “although i think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends mr. ronald weasley and miss hermione granger. yes,” he continued when harry looked startled “i think they ought to know. you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them.” “i didn’t want — ” “ — to worry or frighten them?” said dumbledore surveying harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened you need your friends harry. as you so rightly said sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.” harry said nothing but dumbledore did not seem to require an answer. he continued “on a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.” “private — with you?” said harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence. “yes. i think it is time that i took a greater hand in your education.” “what will you be teaching me sir?” “oh a little of this a little of that,” said dumbledore airily. harry waited hopefully but dumbledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly. “if i’m having lessons with you i won’t have to do occlumency lessons with snape will i?” “professor snape harry — and no you will not.” “good,” said harry in relief “because they were a — ” he stopped careful not to say what he really thought. “i think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” said dumbledore nodding. harry laughed. “well that means i won’t see much of professor snape from now on,” he said “because he won’t let me carry on potions unless i get ‘outstanding’ in my o.w.l. which i know i haven’t.” “don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said dumbledore gravely. “which now i think of it ought to be some time later today. now two more things harry before we part. “firstly i wish you to keep your invisibility cloak with you at all times from this moment onward. even within hogwarts itself. just in case you understand me?” harry nodded. “and lastly while you stay here the burrow has been given the highest security the ministry of magic can provide. these measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to arthur and molly — all their post for instance is being searched at the ministry before being sent on. they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety. however it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.” “i understand,” said harry quickly. “very well then,” said dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. “i see a light in the kitchen. let us not deprive molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.” an excess of phlegm harry and dumbledore approached the back door of the burrow which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old wellington boots and rusty cauldrons harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. dumbledore knocked three times and harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window. “who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as mrs. weasley’s. “declare yourself!” “it is i dumbledore bringing harry.” the door opened at once. there stood mrs. weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown. “harry dear! gracious albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning!” “we were lucky,” said dumbledore ushering harry over the threshold. “slughorn proved much more persuadable than i had expected. harry’s doing of course. ah hello nymphadora!” harry looked around and saw that mrs. weasley was not alone despite the lateness of the hour. a young witch with a pale heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands. “hello professor,” she said. “wotcher harry.” “hi tonks.” harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there was something forced in her smile. certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair. “i’d better be off,” she said quickly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders. “thanks for the tea and sympathy molly.” “please don’t leave on my account,” said dumbledore courteously “i cannot stay i have urgent matters to discuss with rufus scrimgeour.” “no no i need to get going,” said tonks not meeting dumbledore’s eyes. “ ’night — ” “dear why not come to dinner at the weekend remus and mad-eye are coming — ” “no really molly ... thanks anyway ... good night everyone.” tonks hurried past dumbledore and harry into the yard a few paces beyond the doorstep she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. harry noticed that mrs. weasley looked troubled. “well i shall see you at hogwarts harry,” said dumbledore. “take care of yourself. molly your servant.” he made mrs. weasley a bow and followed tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot. mrs. weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance. “you’re like ron,” she sighed looking him up and down. “both of you look as though you’ve had stretching jinxes put on you. i swear ron’s grown four inches since i last bought him school robes. are you hungry harry?” “yeah i am,” said harry suddenly realizing just how hungry he was. “sit down dear i’ll knock something up.” as harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his knees and settled there purring. “so hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled crookshanks behind the ears. “oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday,” said mrs. weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand. it bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. “everyone’s in bed of course we didn’t expect you for hours. here you are — ” she tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward harry and tipped over mrs. weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup. “bread dear?” “thanks mrs. weasley.” she waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove mrs. weasley sat down opposite him. “so you persuaded horace slughorn to take the job?” harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak. “he taught arthur and me,” said mrs. weasley. “he was at hogwarts for ages started around the same time as dumbledore i think. did you like him?” his mouth now full of bread harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head. “i know what you mean,” said mrs. weasley nodding wisely. “of course he can be charming when he wants to be but arthur’s never liked him much. the ministry’s littered with slughorn’s old favorites he was always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for arthur — didn’t seem to think he was enough of a highflier. well that just shows you even slughorn makes mistakes. i don’t know whether ron’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only just happened — but arthur’s been promoted!” it could not have been clearer that mrs. weasley had been bursting to say this. harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering. “that’s great!” he gasped. “you are sweet,” beamed mrs. weasley possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. “yes rufus scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation and arthur’s heading the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects. it’s a big job he’s got ten people reporting to him now!” “what exactly — ” “well you see in all the panic about you-know-who odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere things that are supposed to guard against you-know-who and the death eaters. you can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off. ... well in the main the perpetrators are just people like mundungus fletcher who’ve never done an honest day’s work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turns up. the other day arthur confiscated a box of cursed sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a death eater. so you see it’s a very important job and i tell him it’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that muggle rubbish.” mrs. weasley ended her speech with a stern look as if it had been harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs. “is mr. weasley still at work?” harry asked. “yes he is. as a matter of fact he’s a tiny bit late. ... he said he’d be back around midnight. ...” she turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. harry recognized it at once it had nine hands each inscribed with the name of a family member and usually hung on the weasleys’ sitting room wall though its current position suggested that mrs. weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal peril.” “it’s been like that for a while now,” said mrs. weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice “ever since you-know-who came back into the open. i suppose everybody’s in mortal danger now. ... i don’t think it can be just our family ... but i don’t know anyone else who’s got a clock like this so i can’t check. oh!” with a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’s face. mr. weasley’s hand had switched to “traveling.” “he’s coming!” and sure enough a moment later there was a knock on the back door. mrs. weasley jumped up and hurried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly “arthur is that you?” “yes,” came mr. weasley’s weary voice. “but i would say that even if i were a death eater dear. ask the question!” “oh honestly ...” “molly!” “all right all right . . . what is your dearest ambition?” “to find out how airplanes stay up.” mrs. weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently mr. weasley was holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut. “molly! i’ve got to ask you your question first!” “arthur really this is just silly. ...” “what do you like me to call you when we’re alone together?” even by the dim light of the lantern harry could tell that mrs. weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck and hastily gulped soup clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl. “mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified mrs. weasley into the crack at the edge of the door. “correct,” said mr. weasley. “now you can let me in.” mrs. weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding red-haired wizard wearing horn rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak. “i still don’t see why we have to go through that every time you come home,” said mrs. weasley still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. “i mean a death eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!” “i know dear but it’s ministry procedure and i have to set an example. something smells good — onion soup?” mr. weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table. “harry! we didn’t expect you until morning!” they shook hands and mr. weasley dropped into the chair beside harry as mrs. weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too. “thanks molly. it’s been a tough night. some idiot’s started selling metamorph-medals. just sling them around your neck and you’ll be able to change your appearance at will. a hundred thousand disguises all for ten galleons!” “and what really happens when you put them on?” “mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies. as if st. mungo’s didn’t have enough to do already!” “it sounds like the sort of thing fred and george would find funny,” said mrs. weasley hesitantly. “are you sure — ” “of course i am!” said mr. weasley. “the boys wouldn’t do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection!” “so is that why you’re late metamorph-medals?” “no we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in elephant and castle but luckily the magical law enforcement squad had sorted it out by the time we got there. ...” harry stifled a yawn behind his hand. “bed,” said an undeceived mrs. weasley at once. “i’ve got fred and george’s room all ready for you you’ll have it to yourself.” “why where are they?” “oh they’re in diagon alley sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they’re so busy,” said mrs. weasley. “i must say i didn’t approve at first but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! come on dear your trunk’s already up there.” “ ’night mr. weasley,” said harry pushing back his chair. crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room. “g’night harry,” said mr. weasley. harry saw mrs. weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. all the hands were once again at “mortal peril.” fred and george’s bedroom was on the second floor. mrs. weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what harry thought was gunpowder. a considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood harry’s school trunk. the room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse. hedwig hooted happily at harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. harry bade mrs. weasley good night put on pajamas and got into one of the beds. there was something hard inside the pillowcase. he groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and orange sweet which he recognized as a puking pastille. smiling to himself he rolled over and was instantly asleep. seconds later or so it seemed to harry he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back the dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. shielding them with one hand he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other. “wuzzgoinon?” “we didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head. “ron don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully. harry’s hand found his glasses and he shoved them on though the light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. a long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and ron weasley came into focus grinning down at him. “all right?” “never been better,” said harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. “you?” “not bad,” said ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. “when did you get here mum’s only just told us!” “about one o’clock this morning.” “were the muggles all right did they treat you okay?” “same as usual,” said harry as hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed “they didn’t talk to me much but i like it better that way. how’re you hermione?” “oh i’m fine,” said hermione who was scrutinizing harry as though he was sickening for something. he thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss sirius’s death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said “what’s the time have i missed breakfast?” “don’t worry about that mum’s bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed,” said ron rolling his eyes. “so what’s been going on?” “nothing much i’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle’s haven’t i?” “come off it!” said ron. “you’ve been off with dumbledore!” “it wasn’t that exciting. he just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. his name’s horace slughorn.” “oh,” said ron looking disappointed. “we thought — ” hermione flashed a warning look at ron and ron changed tack at top speed. “ — we thought it’d be something like that.” “you did?” said harry amused. “yeah ... yeah now umbridge has left obviously we need a new defense against the dark arts teacher don’t we so er what’s he like?” “he looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be head of slytherin,” said harry. “something wrong hermione?” she was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. she rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile. “no of course not! so um did slughorn seem like he’ll be a good teacher?” “dunno,” said harry. “he can’t be worse than umbridge can he?” “i know someone who’s worse than umbridge,” said a voice from the doorway. ron’s younger sister slouched into the room looking irritable. “hi harry.” “what’s up with you?” ron asked. “it’s her,” said ginny plonking herself down on harry’s bed. “she’s driving me mad.” “what’s she done now?” asked hermione sympathetically. “it’s the way she talks to me — you’d think i was about three!” “i know,” said hermione dropping her voice. “she’s so full of herself.” harry was astonished to hear hermione talking about mrs. weasley like this and could not blame ron for saying angrily “can’t you two lay off her for five seconds?” “oh that’s right defend her,” snapped ginny. “we all know you can’t get enough of her.” this seemed an odd comment to make about ron’s mother. starting to feel that he was missing something harry said “who are you — ” but his question was answered before he could finish it. the bedroom door flew open again and harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that hermione and ginny slid off the bed onto the floor. a young woman was standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. she was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow. to complete this vision of perfection she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray. “ ’arry,” she said in a throaty voice. “eet ’as been too long!” as she swept over the threshold toward him mrs. weasley was revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross. “there was no need to bring up the tray i was just about to do it myself!” “eet was no trouble,” said fleur delacour setting the tray across harry’s knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek he felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. “i ’ave been longing to see ’im. you remember my seester gabrielle she never stops talking about ’ariy potter. she will be delighted to see you again.” “oh ... is she here too?” harry croaked. “no no silly boy,” said fleur with a tinkling laugh “i mean next summer when we — but do you not know?” her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at mrs. weasley who said “we hadn’t got around to telling him yet.” fleur turned back to harry swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped mrs. weasley across the face. “bill and i are going to be married!” “oh,” said harry blankly. he could not help noticing how mrs. weasley hermione and ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze. “wow. er — congratulations!” she swooped down upon him and kissed him again. “bill is very busy at ze moment working very ’ard and i only work part-time at gringotts for my eenglish so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get to know ’is family properly. i was so pleased to ’ear you would be coming — zere isn’t much to do ’ere unless you like cooking and chickens! well — enjoy your breakfast ’arry!” with these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her. mrs. weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!” “mum hates her,” said ginny quietly. “i do not hate her!” said mrs. weasley in a cross whisper. “i just think they’ve hurried into this engagement that’s all!” “they’ve known each other a year,” said ron who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door. “well that’s not very long! i know why it’s happened of course. it’s all this uncertainty with you-know-who coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions they’d normally take time over. it was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center — ” “including you and dad,” said ginny slyly. “yes well your father and i were made for each other what was the point in waiting?” said mrs. weasley. “whereas bill and fleur . . . well . . . what have they really got in common he’s a hardworking down-to earth sort of person whereas she’s — ” “a cow,” said ginny nodding. “but bill’s not that down-to-earth. he’s a curse-breaker isn’t he he likes a bit of adventure a bit of glamour. ... i expect that’s why he’s gone for phlegm.” “stop calling her that ginny,” said mrs. weasley sharply as harry and hermione laughed. “well i’d better get on. ... eat your eggs while they’re warm harry.” looking careworn she left the room. ron still seemed slightly punch-drunk he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water. “don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same house?” harry asked. “well you do,” said ron “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly like then ...” “it’s pathetic,” said hermione furiously striding away from ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall. “you don’t really want her around forever?” ginny asked ron incredulously. when he merely shrugged she said “well mum’s going to put a stop to it if she can i bet you anything.” “how’s she going to manage that?” asked harry. “she keeps trying to get tonks round for dinner. i think she’s hoping bill will fall for tonks instead. i hope he does i’d much rather have her in the family.” “yeah that’ll work,” said ron sarcastically. “listen no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy tonks when fleur’s around. i mean tonks is okay-looking when she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose but — ” “she’s a damn sight nicer than phlegm,” said ginny “and she’s more intelligent she’s an auror!” said hermione from the corner. “fleur’s not stupid she was good enough to enter the triwizard tournament,” said harry. “not you as well!” said hermione bitterly. “i suppose you like the way phlegm says ‘’arry,’ do you?” asked ginny scornfully. “no,” said harry wishing he hadn’t spoken “i was just saying phlegm — i mean fleur — ” “i’d much rather have tonks in the family,” said ginny. “at least she’s a laugh.” “she hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said ron. “every time i’ve seen her she’s looked more like moaning myrtle.” “that’s not fair,” snapped hermione. “she still hasn’t got over what happened . . . you know ... i mean he was her cousin!” harry’s heart sank. they had arrived at sirius. he picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation. “tonks and sirius barely knew each other!” said ron. “sirius was in azkaban half her life and before that their families never met — ” “that’s not the point,” said hermione. “she thinks it was her fault he died!” “how does she work that one out?” asked harry in spite of himself. “well she was fighting bellatrix lestrange wasn’t she i think she feels that if only she had finished her off bellatrix couldn’t have killed sirius.” “that’s stupid,” said ron. “it’s survivor’s guilt,” said hermione. “i know lupin’s tried to talk her round but she’s still really down. she’s actually having trouble with her metamorphosing! ” “with her — ” “she can’t change her appearance like she used to,” explained hermione. “i think her powers must have been affected by shock or something.” “i didn’t know that could happen,” said harry. “nor did i,” said hermione “but i suppose if you’re really depressed ...” the door opened again and mrs. weasley popped her head in. “ginny,” she whispered “come downstairs and help me with the lunch.” “i’m talking to this lot!” said ginny outraged. “now!” said mrs. weasley and withdrew. “she only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be alone with phlegm!” said ginny crossly. she swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina. “you lot had better come down quickly too,” she said as she left. harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. hermione was peering into fred and george’s boxes though every now and then she cast sideways looks at harry. ron who was now helping himself to harry’s toast was still gazing dreamily at the door. “what’s this?” hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope. “dunno,” said ron “but if fred and george’ve left it here it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful.” “your mum said the shop’s going well,” said harry. “said fred and george have got a real flair for business.” “that’s an understatement,” said ron. “they’re raking in the galleons! i can’t wait to see the place we haven’t been to diagon alley yet because mum says dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been really busy at work but it sounds excellent.” “and what about percy?” asked harry the third eldest weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. “is he talking to your mum and dad again?” “nope,” said ron. “but he knows your dad was right all along now about voldemort being back — ” “dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,” said hermione. “i heard him telling your mum ron.” “sounds like the sort of mental thing dumbledore would say,” said ron. “he’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,” said harry conversationally. ron choked on his bit of toast and hermione gasped. “you kept that quiet!” said ron. “i only just remembered,” said harry honestly. “he told me last night in your broom shed.” “blimey ... private lessons with dumbledore!” said ron looking impressed. “i wonder why he’s ... ” his voice tailed away. harry saw him and hermione exchange looks. harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. dumbledore had said to do it. ... why not now he fixed his eyes on his fork which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap and said “i don’t know exactly why he’s going to be giving me lessons but i think it must be because of the prophecy.” neither ron nor hermione spoke. harry had the impression that both had frozen. he continued still speaking to his fork “you know the one they were trying to steal at the ministry.” “nobody knows what it said though,” said hermione quickly. “it got smashed.” “although the prophet says — ” began ron but hermione said “shh!” “the prophet’s got it right,” said harry looking up at them both with a great effort hermione seemed frightened and ron amazed. “that glass ball that smashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. i heard the whole thing in dumbledore ’s office he was the one the prophecy was made to so he could tell me. from what it said,” harry took a deep breath “it looks like i’m the one who’s got to finish off voldemort. ... at least it said neither of us could live while the other survives.” the three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. then there was a loud bang and hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke. “hermione!” shouted harry and ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash. hermione emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye. “i squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped. and sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope. “don’t worry,” said ron who was plainly trying not to laugh “mumll fix that she’s good at healing minor injuries — ” “oh well never mind that now!” said hermione hastily. “harry oh harry ...” she sat down on the edge of his bed again. “we wondered after we got back from the ministry ... obviously we didn’t want to say anything to you but from what lucius malfoy said about the prophecy how it was about you and voldemort well we thought it might be something like this. ... oh harry ...” she stared at him then whispered “are you scared?” “not as much as i was,” said harry. “when i first heard it i was . . . but now it seems as though i always knew i’d have to face him in the end. ...” “when we heard dumbledore was collecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy,” said ron eagerly. “and we were kind of right weren’t we he wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner wouldn’t waste his time — he must think you’ve got a chance!” “that’s true,” said hermione. “i wonder what he’ll teach you harry really advanced defensive magic probably ... powerful countercurses ... anti-jinxes ...” harry did not really listen. a warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. he knew that ron and hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him speaking bracing words of comfort not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous was worth more than he could ever tell them. ... and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded hermione. “well at least you know one lesson you’ll be having this year that’s one more than ron and me. i wonder when our o.w.l. results will come?” “can’t be long now it’s been a month,” said ron. “hang on,” said harry as another part of last night’s conversation came back to him. “i think dumbledore said our o.w.l. results would be arriving today!” “today?” shrieked hermione. “today but why didn’t you — oh my god — you should have said — ” she leapt to her feet. “i’m going to see whether any owls have come. ...” but when harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it was to find hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation while mrs. weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda. “it just won’t budge,” mrs. weasley was saying anxiously standing over hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of the healer’s helpmate open at “bruises cuts and abrasions.” “this has always worked before i just can’t understand it.” “it’ll be fred and george’s idea of a funny joke making sure it can’t come off,” said ginny “but it’s got to come off!” squeaked hermione. “i can’t go around looking like this forever!” “you won’t dear we’ll find an antidote don’t worry,” said mrs. weasley soothingly. “bill told me ’ow fred and george are very amusing!” said fleur smiling serenely. “yes i can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped hermione. she jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her fingers together. “mrs. weasley you’re quite quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?” “yes dear i’d have noticed,” said mrs. weasley patiently. “but it’s barely nine there’s still plenty of time. ...” “i know i messed up ancient runes,” muttered hermione feverishly “i definitely made at least one serious mistranslation. and the defense against the dark arts practical was no good at all. i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back — ” “hermione will you shut up you’re not the only one who’s nervous!” barked ron. “and when you’ve got your eleven ‘outstanding’ o.w.l.s ...” “don’t don’t don’t!” said hermione flapping her hands hysterically. “i know i’ve failed everything!” “what happens if we fail?” harry asked the room at large but it was again hermione who answered. “we discuss our options with our head of house i asked professor mcgonagall at the end of last term.” harry’s stomach squirmed. he wished he had eaten less breakfast. “at beauxbatons,” said fleur complacently “we ’ad a different way of doing things. i think eet was better. we sat our examinations after six years of study not five and then — ” fleur’s words were drowned in a scream. hermione was pointing through the kitchen window. three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time. “they’re definitely owls,” said ron hoarsely jumping up to join hermione at the window. “and there are three of them,” said harry hastening to her other side. “one for each of us,” said hermione in a terrified whisper. “oh no ... oh no ... oh no ...” she gripped both harry and ron tightly around the elbows. the owls were flying directly at the burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house was carrying a large square envelope. “oh no\” squealed hermione. mrs. weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. one two three the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. all three of them lifted their right legs. harry moved forward. the letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. he untied it with fumbling fingers. to his left ron was trying to detach his own results to his right hermione’s hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble. nobody in the kitchen spoke. at last harry managed to detach the envelope. he slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside. ordinary wizarding level results pass grades fail grades outstanding o poor p exceeds expectations e dreadful d acceptable a troll t harry james potter has achieved astronomy a care of magical creatures e charms e defense against the dark artso divination p herbology e history of magic d potions e transfiguration e harry read the parchment through several times his breathing becoming easier with each reading. it was all right he had always known that he would fail divination and he had had no chance of passing history of magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else! he ran his finger down the grades ... he had passed well in transfiguration and herbology he had even exceeded expectations at potions! and best of all he had achieved “outstanding” at defense against the dark arts! he looked around. hermione had her back to him and her head bent but ron was looking delighted. “only failed divination and history of magic and who cares about them?” he said happily to harry. “here — swap — ” harry glanced down ron’s grades there were no “outstandings” there. ... “knew you’d be top at defense against the dark arts,” said ron punching harry on the shoulder. “we’ve done all right haven’t we?” “well done!” said mrs. weasley proudly ruffling ron’s hair. “seven o.w.l.s that’s more than fred and george got together!” “hermione?” said ginny tentatively for hermione still hadn’t turned around. “how did you do?” “i — not bad,” said hermione in a small voice. “oh come off it,” said ron striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. “yep — nine ‘outstandings’ and one ‘exceeds expectations’ at defense against the dark arts.” he looked down at her half-amused half-exasperated. “you’re actually disappointed aren’t you?” hermione shook her head but harry laughed. “well we’re n.e.w.t. students now!” grinned ron. “mum are there any more sausages?” harry looked back down at his results. they were as good as he could have hoped for. he felt just one tiny twinge of regret. ... this was the end of his ambition to become an auror. he had not secured the required potions grade. he had known all along that he wouldn’t but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black e. it was odd really seeing that it had been a death eater in disguise who had first told harry he would make a good auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he couldn’t really think of anything else he would like to be. moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago. ... neither can live while the other survives. ... wouldn’t he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill voldemort 6 draco’s detour harry remained within the confines of the burrow’s garden over the next few weeks. he spent most of his days playing two-a-side quidditch in the weasleys’ orchard he and hermione against ron and ginny hermione was dreadful and ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything mrs. weasley put in front of him. it would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the prophet sometimes bill and mr. weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. to mrs. weasley’s displeasure harry’s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by remus lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever. “there have been another couple of dementor attacks,” he announced as mrs. weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake. “and they’ve found igor karkaroff’s body in a shack up north. the dark mark had been set over it — well frankly i’m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the death eaters sirius’s brother regulus only managed a few days as far as i can remember.” “yes well,” said mrs. weasley frowning “perhaps we should talk about something diff — ” “did you hear about florean fortescue remus?” asked bill who was being plied with wine by fleur. “the man who ran — ” “ — the ice-cream place in diagon alley?” harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. “he used to give me free ice creams. what’s happened to him?” “dragged off by the look of his place.” “why?” asked ron while mrs. weasley pointedly glared at bill. “who knows he must’ve upset them somehow. he was a good man florean.” “talking of diagon alley,” said mr. weasley “looks like ollivander’s gone too.” “the wandmaker?” said ginny looking startled. “that’s the one. shop’s empty. no sign of a struggle. no one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.” “but wands — what’ll people do for wands?” “they’ll make do with other makers,” said lupin. “but ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.” the day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from hogwarts. harry’s included a surprise he had been made quidditch captain. “that gives you equal status with prefects!” cried hermione happily. “you can use our special bathroom now and everything!” “wow i remember when charlie wore one of these,” said ron examining the badge with glee. “harry this is so cool you’re my captain — if you let me back on the team i suppose ha ha. ...” “well i don’t suppose we can put off a trip to diagon alley much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed mrs. weasley looking down ron’s booklist. “we’ll go on saturday as long as your father doesn’t have to go into work again. i’m not going there without him.” “mum d’you honestly think you-know who’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in flourish and blotts?” sniggered ron. “fortescue and ollivander went on holiday did they?” said mrs. weasley firing up at once. “if you think security’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and i’ll get your things myself — ” “no i wanna come i want to see fred and george’s shop!” said ron hastily. “then you just buck up your ideas young man before i decide you’re too immature to come with us!” said mrs. weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine hands of which were still pointing at “mortal peril,” and balancing it on top of a pile of just laundered towels. “and that goes for returning to hogwarts as well!” ron turned to stare incredulously at harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room. “blimey ... you can’t even make a joke round here anymore. ...” but ron was careful not to be flippant about voldemort over the next few days. saturday dawned without any more outbursts from mrs. weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast. bill who would be staying at home with fleur much to hermione and ginny’s pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to harry. “where’s mine?” demanded ron at once his eyes wide. “that’s already harry’s idiot,” said bill. “i got it out of your vault for you harry because it’s taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much. two days ago arkie philpott had a probity probe stuck up his ... well trust me this way’s easier.” “thanks bill,” said harry pocketing his gold. “ ’e is always so thoughtful,” purred fleur adoringly stroking bill’s nose. ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind fleur. harry choked over his cornflakes and ron thumped him on the back. it was an overcast murky day. one of the special ministry of magic cars in which harry had ridden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks. “it’s good dad can get us these again,” said ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the burrow bill and fleur waving from the kitchen window. he harry hermione and ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat. “don’t get used to it it’s only because of harry,” said mr. weasley over his shoulder. he and mrs. weasley were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. “he’s been given top grade security status. and we’ll be joining up with additional security at the leaky cauldron too.” harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of aurors. he had stowed his invisibility cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the ministry knew about his cloak. “here you are then,” said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time as he slowed in charing cross road and stopped outside the leaky cauldron. “i’m to wait for you any idea how long you 11 be?” “a couple of hours i expect,” said mr. weasley. “ah good he’s here!” harry imitated mr. weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt. there were no aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic black bearded form of rubeus hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of harry’s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing muggles. “harry!” he boomed sweeping harry into a bone crushing hug the moment harry had stepped out of the car. “buckbeak — witherwings i mean — yeh should see him harry he’s so happy ter be back in the open air — ” “glad he’s pleased,” said harry grinning as he massaged his ribs. “we didn’t know ‘security’ meant you!” “i know jus’ like old times innit see the ministry wanted ter send a bunch o’ aurors but dumbledore said i’d do,” said hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. “let’s get goin’ then — after yeh molly arthur — ” the leaky cauldron was for the first time in harry’s memory completely empty. only tom the landlord wizened and toothless remained of the old crowd. he looked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak hagrid said importantly “jus’ passin’ through today tom sure yeh understand hogwarts business yeh know.” tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses harry hermione hagrid and the weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. they stepped through the entrance and paused looking around. diagon alley had changed. the colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic posters that had been pasted over them. most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving black-and-white photographs of death eaters known to be on the loose. bellatrix lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. a few windows were boarded up including those of florean fortescue’s ice cream parlor. on the other hand a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front amulets effective against werewolves dementors and inferi a seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby. “one for your little girl madam?” he called at mrs. weasley as they passed leering at ginny. “protect her pretty neck?” “if i were on duty ...” said mr. weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller. “yes but don’t go arresting anyone now dear we’re in a hurry,” said mrs. weasley nervously consulting a list. “i think we’d better do madam malkin’s first hermione wants new dress robes and ron’s showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too harry you’ve grown so much — come on everyone — ” “molly it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to madam malkin’s,” said mr. weasley. “why don’t those three go with hagrid and we can go to flourish and blotts and get everyone’s schoolbooks?” “i don’t know,” said mrs. weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. “hagrid do you think — ” “don’ fret they’ll be fine with me molly,” said hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. mrs. weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and ginny while harry ron hermione and hagrid set off for madam malkin’s. harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look as mrs. weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business. nobody seemed to be shopping alone. “migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” said hagrid stopping outside madam malkin’s and bending down to peer through the window. “i’ll stand guard outside all right?” so harry ron and hermione entered the little shop together. it appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue. ... not a child in case you haven’t noticed mother. i am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.” there was a clucking noise and a voice harry recognized as that of madam malkin the owner said “now dear your mother’s quite right none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore it’s nothing to do with being a child — ” “watch where you’re sticking that pin will you!” a teenage boy with a pale pointed face and white blond hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. he strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed harry ron and hermione reflected over his shoulder. his light gray eyes narrowed. “if you’re wondering what the smell is mother a mudblood just walked in,” said draco malfoy. “i don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” said madam malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. “and i don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!” she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her harry and ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at malfoy. hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered “no don’t honestly it’s not worth it. ...” “yeah like you’d dare do magic out of school,” sneered malfoy. “who blacked your eye granger i want to send them flowers.” “that’s quite enough!” said madam malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support. “madam — please — ” narcissa malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack. “put those away,” she said coldly to harry and ron. “if you attack my son again i shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.” “really?” said harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her sister’s. he was as tall as she was now. “going to get a few death eater pals to do us in are you?” madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart. “really you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away please!” but harry did not lower his wand. narcissa malfoy smiled unpleasantly. “i see that being dumbledore’s favorite has given you a false sense of security harry potter. but dumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.” harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “wow ... look at that ... he’s not here now! so why not have a go they might be able to find you a double cell in azkaban with your loser of a husband!” malfoy made an angry movement toward harry but stumbled over his overlong robe. ron laughed loudly. “don’t you dare talk to my mother like that potter!” malfoy snarled. “it’s all right draco,” said narcissa restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. “i expect potter will be reunited with dear sirius before i am reunited with lucius.” harry raised his wand higher. “harry no!” moaned hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. “think. ... you mustn’t. ... you’ll be in such trouble. ...” madam malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn’t. she bent toward malfoy who was still glaring at harry. “i think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just — ” “ouch!” bellowed malfoy slapping her hand away. “watch where you’re putting your pins woman! mother — i don’t think i want these anymore — ” he pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam malkin’s feet. “you’re right draco,” said narcissa with a contemptuous glance at hermione “now i know the kind of scum that shops here. ... we’ll do better at twilfitt and tatting’s.” and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into ron on the way out. “well reallyl” said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust. she was distracted all through the fitting of ron’s and harry’s new robes tried to sell hermione wizard’s dress robes instead of witch’s and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them. “got ev’rything?” asked hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side. “just about,” said harry. “did you see the malfoys?” “yeah,” said hagrid unconcerned. “bu’ they wouldn’ dare make trouble in the middle o’ diagon alley harry. don’ worry abou’ them.” harry ron and hermione exchanged looks but before they could disabuse hagrid of this comfortable notion mr. and mrs. weasley and ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books. “everyone all right?” said mrs. weasley. “got your robes right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to fred and george’s — stick close now. ...” neither harry nor ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for hedwig and pigwidgeon at eeylops owl emporium. then with mrs. weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of weasleys’ wizard wheezes the joke shop run by fred and george. “we really haven’t got too long,” mrs. weasley said. “so we’ll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. we must be close that’s number ninety two ... ninety-four ...” “whoa,” said ron stopping in his tracks. set against the dull poster-muffled shop fronts around them fred and george’s windows hit the eye like a firework display. casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a halt transfixed. the left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked harry’s eyes began to water just looking at it. the right-hand window was covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters why are you worrying about you-know-who you should be worrying about u-no-poo— the constipation sensation that’s gripping the nation! harry started to laugh. he heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see mrs. weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster. her lips moved silently mouthing the name “u-no-poo.” “they’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered. “no they won’t!” said ron who like harry was laughing. “this is brilliant!” and he and harry led the way into the shop. it was packed with customers harry could not get near the shelves. he stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts harry noticed that the nosebleed nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf. there were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in self inking spell-checking and smart-answer varieties. a space cleared in the crowd and harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangman — spell it or he’ll swing! “ ‘patented daydream charms . . . ’ ” hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. “ ‘one simple incantation and you will enter a top quality highly realistic thirty-minute daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). not for sale to under-sixteens.’ you know,” said hermione looking up at harry “that really is extraordinary magic!” “for that hermione,” said a voice behind them “you can have one for free.” a beaming fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair. “how are you harry?” they shook hands. “and what’s happened to your eye hermione?” “your punching telescope,” she said ruefully. “oh blimey i forgot about those,” said fred. “here — ” he pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste. “just dab it on that bruise’ll be gone within the hour,” said fred. “we had to find a decent bruise remover. we’re testing most of our products on ourselves.” hermione looked nervous. “it is safe isn’t it?” she asked. “ ’course it is,” said fred bracingly. “come on harry i’ll give you a tour.” harry left hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks. “muggle magic tricks!” said fred happily pointing them out. “for freaks like dad you know who love muggle stuff. it’s not a big earner but we do fairly steady business they’re great novelties. ... oh here’s george. ...” fred’s twin shook harry’s hand energetically. “giving him the tour come through the back harry that’s where we’re making the real money — pocket anything you and you’ll pay in more than galleonsv’ he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark marks — they’ll make anyone sick! george pushed back a curtain beside the muggle tricks and harry saw a darker less crowded room. the packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued. “we’ve just developed this more serious line,” said fred. “funny how it happened ...” “you wouldn’t believe how many people even people who work at the ministry can’t do a decent shield charm,” said george. “ ’course they didn’t have you teaching them harry.” “that’s right. ... well we thought shield hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. but the ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! and we’re still getting massive orders!” “so we’ve expanded into a range of shield cloaks shield gloves ...” ... i mean they wouldn’t help much against the unforgivable curses but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes ...” “and then we thought we’d get into the whole area of defense against the dark arts because it’s such a money spinner,” continued george enthusiastically. “this is cool. look instant darkness powder we’re importing it from peru. handy if you want to make a quick escape.” “and our decoy detonators are just walking off the shelves look,” said fred pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. “you just drop one surreptitiously and it’ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one. “handy,” said harry impressed. “here,” said george catching a couple and throwing them to harry. a young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes. “there’s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron mr. weasley and mr. weasley,” she said. harry found it very odd to hear fred and george called “mr. weasley,” but they took it in their stride. “right you are verity i’m coming,” said george promptly. “harry you help yourself to anything you want all right no charge.” “i can’t do that!” said harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the decoy detonators. “you don’t pay here,” said fred firmly waving away harry’s gold. “but — ” “you gave us our start-up loan we haven’t forgotten,” said george sternly. “take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask.” george swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and fred led harry back into the main part of the shop to find hermione and ginny still poring over the patented daydream charms. “haven’t you girls found our special wonderwitch products yet?” asked fred. “follow me ladies. ...” near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. hermione and ginny both hung back looking wary. “there you go,” said fred proudly. “best range of love potions you’ll find anywhere.” ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “do they work?” she asked. “certainly they work for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question “ — and the attractiveness of the girl,” said george reappearing suddenly at their side. “but we’re not selling them to our sister,” he added becoming suddenly stern “not when she’s already got about five boys on the go from what we’ve — ” “whatever you’ve heard from ron is a big fat lie,” said ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. “what’s this?” “guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said fred. “excellent on everything from boils to blackheads but don’t change the subject. are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called dean thomas?” “yes i am,” said ginny. “and last time i looked he was definitely one boy not five. what are those?” she was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. “pygmy puffs,” said george. “miniature puffskeins we can’t breed them fast enough. so what about michael corner?” “i dumped him he was a bad loser,” said ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the pygmy puffs crowd around it. “they’re really cute!” “they’re fairly cuddly yes,” conceded fred. “but you’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast aren’t you?” ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips. there was such a mrs. weasley-ish glare on her face that harry was surprised fred didn’t recoil. “it’s none of your business. and i’ll thank you,” she added angrily to ron who had just appeared at george’s elbow laden with merchandise “not to tell tales about me to these two!” “that’s three galleons nine sickles and a knut,” said fred examining the many boxes in ron’s arms. “cough up.” “i’m your brother!” “and that’s our stuff you’re nicking. three galleons nine sickles. i’ll knock off the knut.” “but i haven’t got three galleons nine sickles!” “you’d better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves.” ron dropped several boxes swore and made a rude hand gesture at fred that was unfortunately spotted by mrs. weasley who had chosen that moment to appear. “if i see you do that again i’ll jinx your fingers together,” she said sharply. “mum can i have a pygmy puff?” said ginny at once. “a what?” said mrs. weasley warily. “look they’re so sweet. ...” mrs. weasley moved aside to look at the pygmy puffs and harry ron and hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. draco malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. as he passed weasleys’ wizard wheezes he glanced over his shoulder. seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him. “wonder where his mummy is?” said harry frowning. “given her the slip by the looks of it,” said ron. “why though?” said hermione. harry said nothing he was thinking too hard. narcissa malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches. harry knowing and loathing malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent. he glanced around. mrs. weasley and ginny were bending over the pygmy puffs. mr. weasley was delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing cards. fred and george were both helping customers. on the other side of the glass hagrid was standing with his back to them looking up and down the street. “get under here quick,” said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag. “oh — i don’t know harry,” said hermione looking uncertainly toward mrs. weasley. “come on\” said ron. she hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with harry and ron. nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in fred and george’s products. harry ron and hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the street malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had. “he was going in that direction,” murmured harry as quietly as possible so that the humming hagrid would not hear them. “c’mon.” they scurried along peering left and right through shop windows and doors until hermione pointed ahead. “that’s him isn’t it?” she whispered. “turning left?” “big surprise,” whispered ron. for malfoy had glanced around then slid into knockturn alley and out of sight. “quick or we’ll lose him,” said harry speeding up. “our feet’ll be seen!” said hermione anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays. “it doesn’t matter,” said harry impatiently. “just hurry!” but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark arts looked completely deserted. they peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy dark artifacts — or at least to be seen buying them. hermione gave his arm a hard pinch. “ouch!” “shh! look! he’s in there!” she breathed in harry’s ear. they had drawn level with the only shop in knockturn alley that harry had ever visited borgin and burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. there in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood draco malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which harry had once hidden to avoid malfoy and his father. judging by the movements of malfoy’s hands he was talking animatedly. the proprietor of the shop mr. borgin an oily-haired stooping man stood facing malfoy. he was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear. “if only we could hear what they’re saying!” said hermione. “we can!” said ron excitedly. “hang on — damn — ” he dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest. “extendable ears look!” “fantastic!” said hermione as ron unraveled the long fleshcolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. “oh i hope the door isn’t imperturbable — ” “no!” said ron gleefully. “listen!” they put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which malfoy’s voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on. ... you know how to fix it?” “possibly,” said borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. “i’ll need to see it though. why don’t you bring it into the shop?” “i can’t,” said malfoy. “it’s got to stay put. i just need you to tell me how to do it.” harry saw borgin lick his lips nervously. “well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible. i couldn’t guarantee anything.” “no?” said malfoy and harry knew just by his tone that malfoy was sneering. “perhaps this will make you more confident.” he moved toward borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. harry ron and hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was borgin looking very frightened. “tell anyone,” said malfoy “and there will be retribution. you know fenrir greyback he’s a family friend. he’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.” “there will be no need for — ” “i’ll decide that,” said malfoy. “well i’d better be off. and don’t forget to keep that one safe i’ll need it.” “perhaps you’d like to take it now?” “no of course i wouldn’t you stupid little man how would i look carrying that down the street just don’t sell it.” “of course not ... sir.” borgin made a bow as deep as the one harry had once seen him give lucius malfoy. “not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand?” “naturally naturally,” murmured borgin bowing again. next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. he passed so close to harry ron and hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. inside the shop borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried. “what was that about?” whispered ron reeling in the extendable ears. “dunno,” said harry thinking hard. “he wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. ... could you see what he pointed at when he said ‘that one’?” “no he was behind that cabinet — ” “you two stay here,” whispered hermione. “what are you — ” but hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. she checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again. ron hastily fed the extendable ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to harry. “hello horrible morning isn’t it?” hermione said brightly to borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look. humming cheerily hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display. “is this necklace for sale?” she asked pausing beside a glass-fronted case. “if you’ve got one and a half thousand galleons,” said mr. borgin coldly. “oh — er — no i haven’t got quite that much,” said hermione walking on. “and ... what about this lovely — um — skull?” “sixteen galleons.” “so it’s for sale then it isn’t being ... kept for anyone?” mr. borgin squinted at her. harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what hermione was up to. apparently hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds. “the thing is that — er — boy who was in here just now draco malfoy well he’s a friend of mine and i want to get him a birthday present but if he’s already reserved anything i obviously don’t want to get him the same thing so ... um ...” it was a pretty lame story in harry’s opinion and apparently borgin thought so too. “out,” he said sharply. “get out!” hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heels. as the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign. “ah well,” said ron throwing the cloak back over hermione. “worth a try but you were a bit obvious — “well next time you can show me how it’s done master of mystery!” she snapped. ron and hermione bickered all the way back to weasleys’ wizard wheezes where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking mrs. weasley and hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence. once in the shop harry whipped off the invisibility cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to mrs. weasley’s accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly. 7 the slug club harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of malfoy’s behavior in knockturn alley. what disturbed him most was the satisfied look on malfoy’s face as he had left the shop. nothing that made malfoy look that happy could be good news. to his slight annoyance however neither ron nor hermione seemed quite as curious about malfoy’s activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days. “yes i’ve already agreed it was fishy harry,” said hermione a little impatiently. she was sitting on the windowsill in fred and george’s room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation. “but haven’t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?” “maybe he’s broken his hand of glory,” said ron vaguely as he attempted to straighten his broomstick’s bent tail twigs. “remember that shriveled-up arm malfoy had?” “but what about when he said ‘don’t forget to keep that one safe’?” asked harry for the umpteenth time. “that sounded to me like borgin’s got another one of the broken objects and malfoy wants both.” “you reckon?” said ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle. “yeah i do,” said harry. when neither ron nor hermione answered he said “malfoy’s father’s in azkaban. don’t you think malfoy’d like revenge?” ron looked up blinking. “malfoy revenge what can he do about it?” “that’s my point i don’t know!” said harry frustrated. “but he’s up to something and i think we should take it seriously. his father’s a death eater and — ” harry broke off his eyes fixed on the window behind hermione his mouth open. a startling thought had just occurred to him. “harry?” said hermione in an anxious voice. “what’s wrong?” “your scar’s not hurting again is it?” asked ron nervously. “he’s a death eater,” said harry slowly. “he’s replaced his father as a death eater!” there was a silence then ron erupted in laughter. “malfoy he’s sixteen harry! you think you-know who would let malfoy join?” “it seems very unlikely harry,” said hermione in a repressive sort of voice. “what makes you think — ” “in madam malkin’s. she didn’t touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. it was his left arm. he’s been branded with the dark mark.” ron and hermione looked at each other. “well ...” said ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced. “i think he just wanted to get out of there harry,” said hermione. “he showed borgin something we couldn’t see,” harry pressed on stubbornly. “something that seriously scared borgin. it was the mark i know it — he was showing borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriously borgin took him!” ron and hermione exchanged another look. “i’m not sure harry. ...” “yeah i still don’t reckon you-know-who would let malfoy join. ...” annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right harry snatched up a pile of filthy quidditch robes and left the room mrs. weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. on the landing he bumped into ginny who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes. “i wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned him. “there’s a lot of phlegm around.” “i’ll be careful not to slip in it.” harry smiled. sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plans for her wedding to bill while mrs. weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts looking bad-tempered. “... bill and i ’ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids ginny and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. i am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold — pink would of course be ’orrible with ginny’s ’air — “ah harry!” said mrs. weasley loudly cutting across fleur’s monologue. “good i wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to hogwarts tomorrow. we’ve got ministry cars again and there will be aurors waiting at the station — ” “is tonks going to be there?” asked harry handing over his quidditch things. “no i don’t think so she’s been stationed somewhere else from what arthur said.” “she has let ’erself go zat tonks,” fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. “a big mistake if you ask — ” “yes thank you,” said mrs. weasley tartly cutting across fleur again. “you’d better get on harry i want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we don’t have the usual last-minute scramble.” and in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. the ministry cars glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunks packed hermione’s cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and hedwig ron’s owl pigwidgeon and ginny’s new purple pygmy puff arnold in cages. “au revoir ’ariy,” said fleur throatily kissing him good-bye. ron hurried forward looking hopeful but ginny stuck out her foot and ron fell sprawling in the dust at fleur’s feet. furious red-faced and dirt spattered he hurried into the car without saying good-bye. there was no cheerful hagrid waiting for them at king’s cross station. instead two grim-faced bearded aurors in dark muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking. “quick quick through the barrier,” said mrs. weasley who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. “harry had better go first with — ” she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized harry’s upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. “i can walk thanks,” said harry irritably jerking his arm out of the auror’s grip. he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and three-quarters where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd. hermione and the weasleys joined him within seconds. without waiting to consult his grim-faced auror harry motioned to ron and hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment. “we can’t harry,” said hermione looking apologetic. “ron and i’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.” “oh yeah i forgot,” said harry. “you’d better get straight on the train all of you you’ve only got a few minutes to go,” said mrs. weasley consulting her watch. “well have a lovely term ron. ...” “mr. weasley can i have a quick word?” said harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment. “of course,” said mr. weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless. harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell anyone mr. weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly because he thought that there was not too much risk of mr. weasley exploding with anger. he could see mrs. weasley and the grim-faced auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away. “when we were in diagon alley,” harry began but mr. weasley forestalled him with a grimace. “am i about to discover where you ron and hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of fred and george’s shop?” “how did you — ” “harry please. you’re talking to the man who raised fred and george.” “er ... yeah all right we weren’t in the back room.” “very well then let’s hear the worst.” “well we followed draco malfoy. we used my invisibility cloak.” “did you have any particular reason for doing so or was it a mere whim?” “because i thought malfoy was up to something,” said harry disregarding mr. weasley’s look of mingled exasperation and amusement. “he’d given his mother the slip and i wanted to know why.” “of course you did,” said mr. weasley sounding resigned. “well did you find out why?” “he went into borgin and burkes,” said harry “and started bullying the bloke in there borgin to help him fix something. and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him. he made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. like they were a pair. and ...” harry took a deep breath. “there’s something else. we saw malfoy jump about a mile when madam malkin tried to touch his left arm. i think he’s been branded with the dark mark. i think he’s replaced his father as a death eater.” mr. weasley looked taken aback. after a moment he said “harry i doubt whether you-know-who would allow a sixteen-year-old — ” “does anyone really know what you-know-who would or wouldn’t do?” asked harry angrily. “mr. weasley i’m sorry but isn’t it worth investigating if malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten borgin to get it done it’s probably something dark or dangerous isn’t it?” “i doubt it to be honest harry,” said mr. weasley slowly. “you see when lucius malfoy was arrested we raided his house. we took away everything that might have been dangerous.” “i think you missed something,” said harry stubbornly. “well maybe,” said mr. weasley but harry could tell that mr. weasley was humoring him. there was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing. “you’d better hurry,” said mr. weasley as mrs. weasley cried “harry quickly!” he hurried forward and mr. and mrs. weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train. “now dear you’re coming to us for christmas it’s all fixed with dumbledore so we’ll see you quite soon,” said mrs. weasley through the window as harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. “you make sure you look after yourself and — ” the train was gathering speed. “ — be good and — ” she was jogging to keep up now. stay safe!” harry waved until the train had turned a corner and mr. and mrs. weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to. he supposed ron and hermione were cloistered in the prefects’ carriage but ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends. he made his way toward her dragging his trunk. people stared shamelessly as he approached. they even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the “chosen one” rumors in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. he tapped ginny on the shoulder. “fancy trying to find a compartment?” “i can’t harry i said i’d meet dean,” said ginny brightly. “see you later.” “right,” said harry. he felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that ginny did not hang around with him ron and hermione while at school. then he blinked and looked around he was surrounded by mesmerized girls. “hi harry!” said a familiar voice from behind him. “neville!” said harry in relief turning to see a round faced boy struggling toward him. “hello harry,” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just behind neville. “luna hi how are you?” “very well thank you,” said luna. she was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free spectrespecs inside. “quibbler still going strong then?” asked harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year. “oh yes circulation’s well up,” said luna happily. “let’s find seats,” said harry and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. at last they found an empty compartment and harry hurried inside gratefully. “they’re even staring at us!” said neville indicating himself and luna. “because we’re with you!” “they’re staring at you because you were at the ministry too,” said harry as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. “our little adventure there was all over the daily prophet you must’ve seen it.” “yes i thought gran would be angry about all the publicity,” said neville “but she was really pleased. says i’m starting to live up to my dad at long last. she bought me a new wand look!” he pulled it out and showed it to harry. “cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly. “we think it was one of the last ollivander ever sold he vanished next day — oi come back here trevor!” and he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom. “are we still doing d.a. meetings this year harry?” asked luna who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of the quibbler. “no point now we’ve got rid of umbridge is there?” said harry sitting down. neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. he looked most disappointed. “i liked the d.a.! i learned loads with you!” “i enjoyed the meetings too,” said luna serenely. “it was like having friends.” this was one of those uncomfortable things luna often said and which made harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass. “you ask him!” “no you!” “i’ll do it!” and one of them a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door. “hi harry i’m romilda romilda vane,” she said loudly and confidently. “why don’t you join us in our compartment you don’t have to sit with them,” she added in a stage whisper indicating neville’s bottom which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for trevor and luna who was now wearing her free spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl. “they’re friends of mine,” said harry coldly. “oh,” said the girl looking very surprised. “oh. okay.” and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her. “people expect you to have cooler friends than us,” said luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty. “you are cool,” said harry shortly. “none of them was at the ministry. they didn’t fight with me.” “that’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed luna. then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the quibbler. “we didn’t face him though,” said neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking trevor in his hand. “you did. you should hear my gran talk about you. ‘that harry potter’s got more backbone than the whole ministry of magic put together*.’ she’d give anything to have you as a grandson. ...” harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to o.w.l. results as soon as he could. while neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration n.e.w.t. with only an “acceptable,” harry watched him without really listening. neville’s childhood had been blighted by voldemort just as much as harry’s had but neville had no idea how close he had come to having harry’s destiny. the prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons voldemort had chosen to believe that harry was the one meant. had voldemort chosen neville it would be neville sitting opposite harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy. ... or would it would neville’s mother have died to save him as lily had died for harry surely she would. ... but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and voldemort would there then have been no “chosen one” at all an empty seat where neville now sat and a scarless harry who would have been kissed good bye by his own mother not ron’s “you all right harry you look funny,” said neville. harry started. “sorry — i — ” “wrackspurt got you?” asked luna sympathetically peering at harry through her enormous colored spectacles. “i — what?” “a wrackspurt ... they’re invisible. they float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she said. “i thought i felt one zooming around in here.” she flapped her hands at thin air as though beating off large invisible moths. harry and neville caught each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of quidditch. the weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed through stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight. it was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that ron and hermione entered the compartment at last. “wish the lunch trolley would hurry up i’m starving,” said ron longingly slumping into the seat beside harry and rubbing his stomach. “hi neville. hi luna. guess what?” he added turning to harry. “malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. he’s just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed.” harry sat up straight interested. it was not like malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year. “what did he do when he saw you?” “the usual,” said ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand gesture. “not like him though is it well — that is” — he did the hand gesture again — “but why isn’t he out there bullying first years “dunno,” said harry but his mind was racing. didn’t this look as though malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students “maybe he preferred the inquisitorial squad,” said hermione. “maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.” “i don’t think so,” said harry. “i think he’s — ” but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third year girl stepped inside. “i’m supposed to deliver these to neville longbottom and harry p-potter,” she faltered as her eyes met harry’s and she turned scarlet. she was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. perplexed harry and neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment. “what is it?” ron demanded as harry unrolled his. “an invitation,” said harry. harry i would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment c. sincerely professor h. e. f. slug horn “who’s professor slughorn?” asked neville looking perplexedly at his own invitation. “new teacher,” said harry. “well i suppose we’ll have to go won’t we?” “but what does he want me for?” asked neville nervously as though he was expecting detention. “no idea,” said harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. “listen,” he added seized by a sudden brain wave “let’s go under the invisibility cloak then we might get a good look at malfoy on the way see what he’s up to.” this idea however came to nothing the corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. the exception was cho chang who darted into her compartment when she saw harry coming. as harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. smirking slightly harry pushed on. when they reached compartment c they saw at once that they were not slughorn’s only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of slughorn’s welcome harry was the most warmly anticipated. “harry m’boy!” said slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. his shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat. “good to see you good to see you! and you must be mr. longbottom!” neville nodded looking scared. at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door. harry glanced around at their fellow guests. he recognized a slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slanting eyes there were also two seventh-year boys harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there ginny. “now do you know everyone?” slughorn asked harry and neville. “blaise zabini is in your year of course — zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did harry or neville gryffindor and slytherin students loathed each other on principle. “this is cormac mclaggen perhaps you’ve come across each other —  no?” mclaggen a large wiry-haired youth raised a hand and harry and neville nodded back at him. “ — and this is marcus belby i don’t know whether — ” belby who was thin and nervous-looking gave a strained smile. “ — and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!” slughorn finished. ginny grimaced at harry and neville from behind slughorn’s back. “well now this is most pleasant,” said slughorn cozily. “a chance to get to know you all a little better. here take a napkin. i’ve packed my own lunch the trolley as i remember it is heavy on licorice wands and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up to such things. ... pheasant belby?” belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant. “i was just telling young marcus here that i had the pleasure of teaching his uncle damocles,” slughorn told harry and neville now passing around a basket of rolls. “outstanding wizard outstanding and his order of merlin most well-deserved. do you see much of your uncle marcus?” unfortunately belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke. “anapneo,” said slughorn calmly pointing his wand at belby whose airway seemed to clear at once. “not ... not much of him no,” gasped belby his eyes streaming. “well of course i daresay he’s busy,” said slughorn looking questioningly at belby. “i doubt he invented the wolfsbane potion without considerable hard work!” “i suppose ...” said belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that slughorn had finished with him. “er ... he and my dad don’t get on very well you see so i don’t really know much about ...” his voice tailed away as slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to mclaggen instead. “now you cormac,” said slughorn “i happen to know you see a lot of your uncle tiberius because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in i think norfolk?” “oh yeah that was fun that was,” said mclaggen. “we went with bertie higgs and rufus scrimgeour — this was before he became minister obviously — ” “ah you know bertie and rufus too?” beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow belby was missed out. “now tell me ...” it was as harry had suspected. everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential — everyone except ginny. zabini who was interrogated after mclaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). it was neville’s turn next this was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for neville’s parents well known aurors had been tortured into insanity by bellatrix lestrange and a couple of death eater cronies. at the end of neville’s interview harry had the impression that slughorn was reserving judgment on neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents’ flair. “and now,” said slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. “harry potter! where to begin i feel i barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!” he contemplated harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said “ the chosen one,’ they’re calling you now!” harry said nothing. belby mclaggen and zabini were all staring at him. “of course,” said slughorn watching harry closely “there have been rumors for years. ... i remember when — well — after that terrible night — lily — james — and you survived — and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary — ” zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism. an angry voice burst out from behind slughorn. “yeah zabini because you’re so talented ... at posing. “oh dear!” chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at ginny who was glaring at zabini around slughorn ’s great belly. “you want to be careful blaise! i saw this young lady perform the most marvelous bat-bogey hex as i was passing her carriage! i wouldn’t cross her!” zabini merely looked contemptuous. “anyway,” said slughorn turning back to harry. “such rumors this summer. of course one doesn’t know what to believe the prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes — but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!” harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing. slughorn beamed at him. “so modest so modest no wonder dumbledore is so fond — you were there then but the rest of the stories — so sensational of course one doesn’t know quite what to believe — this fabled prophecy for instance — ” “we never heard a prophecy,” said neville turning geranium pink as he said it. “that’s right,” said ginny staunchly. “neville and i were both there too and all this ‘chosen one’ rubbish is just the prophet making things up as usual.” “you were both there too were you?” said slughorn with great interest looking from ginny to neville but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile. “yes . . . well ... it is true that the prophet often exaggerates of course. ...” slughorn said sounding a little disappointed. “i remember dear gwenog telling me gwenog jones i mean of course captain of the holyhead harpies — ” he meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence but harry had the distinct impression that slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by neville and ginny. the afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the “slug club” at hogwarts. harry could not wait to leave but couldn’t see how to do so politely. finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight. “good gracious it’s getting dark already! i didn’t notice that they’d lit the lamps! you’d better go and change into your robes all of you. mclaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. harry blaise — any time you’re passing. same goes for you miss,” he twinkled at ginny. “well off you go off you go!” as he pushed past harry into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that harry returned with interest. he ginny and neville followed zabini back along the train. “i’m glad that’s over,” muttered neville. “strange man isn’t he?” “yeah he is a bit,” said harry his eyes on zabini. “how come you ended up in there ginny?” “he saw me hex zacharias smith,” said ginny. “you remember that idiot from hufflepuff who was in the d.a. he kept on and on asking about what happened at the ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much i hexed him — when slughorn came in i thought i was going to get detention but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch! mad eh?” “better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s famous,” said harry scowling at the back of zabini ’s head “or because their uncle — ” but he broke off. an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea. ... in a minute’s time zabini was going to reenter the slytherin sixth-year compartment and malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow slytherins. ... if harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear true there was little of the journey left — hogsmeade station had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take harry’s suspicions seriously so it was down to him to prove them. “i’ll see you two later,” said harry under his breath pulling out his invisibility cloak and flinging it over himself. “but what’re you — ” asked neville. “later!” whispered harry darting after zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless. the corridors were almost completely empty now. nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. though he was as close as he could get to zabini without touching him harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when zabini opened the door. zabini was already sliding it shut when harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing. “what’s wrong with this thing?” said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into harry’s foot. harry seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into gregory goyle’s lap and in the ensuing ruckus harry darted into the compartment leapt onto zabini’s temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. it was fortunate that goyle and zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eyes onto them for harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw malfoy’s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. but then goyle slammed the door shut and flung zabini off him zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled vincent crabbe returned to his comic and malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in pansy parkinson’s lap. harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off malfoy’s forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. the lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene harry could read every word of crabbe’s comic directly below him. “so zabini,” said malfoy “what did slughorn want?” “just trying to make up to well-connected people,” said zabini who was still glowering at goyle. “not that he managed to find many.” this information did not seem to please malfoy. “who else had he invited?” he demanded. “mclaggen from gryffindor,” said zabini. “oh yeah his uncle’s big in the ministry,” said malfoy. “ — someone else called belby from ravenclaw — ” “not him he’s a prat!” said pansy. “ — and longbottom potter and that weasley girl,” finished zabini. malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking pansy’s hand aside. “he invited longbottom?” “well i assume so as longbottom was there,” said zabini indifferently. “what’s longbottom got to interest slughorn?” zabini shrugged. “potter precious potter obviously he wanted a look at ‘the chosen one,’ ” sneered malfoy “but that weasley girl! what’s so special about her?” “a lot of boys like her,” said pansy watching malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. “even you think she’s good-looking don’t you blaise and we all know how hard you are to please!” “i wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,” said zabini coldly and pansy looked pleased. malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair. “well i pity slughorn’s taste. maybe he’s going a bit senile. shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. my father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. slughorn probably hasn’t heard i’m on the train or — ” “i wouldn’t bank on an invitation,” said zabini. “he asked me about nott’s father when i first arrived. they used to be old friends apparently but when he heard he’d been caught at the ministry he didn’t look happy and nott didn’t get an invitation did he i don’t think slughorn’s interested in death eaters.” malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh. “well who cares what he’s interested in what is he when you come down to it just some stupid teacher.” malfoy yawned ostentatiously. “i mean i might not even be at hogwarts next year what’s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?” “what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year?” said pansy indignantly ceasing grooming malfoy at once. “well you never know,” said malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. “i might have — er — moved on to bigger and better things.” crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak harry’s heart began to race. what would ron and hermione say about this crabbe and goyle were gawping at malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. pansy resumed the slow stroking of malfoy’s hair looking dumbfounded. “do you mean — him?” malfoy shrugged. “mother wants me to complete my education but personally i don’t see it as that important these days. i mean think about it. ... when the dark lord takes over is he going to care how many o.w.l.s or n.e.w.t.s anyone’s got of course he isn’t. ... it’ll be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he was shown.” “and you think you’ll be able to do something for him?” asked zabini scathingly. “sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet?” “i’ve just said haven’t i maybe he doesn’t care if i’m qualified. maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something that you need to be qualified for,” said malfoy quietly. crabbe and goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. pansy was gazing down at malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe inspiring. “i can see hogwarts,” said malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. “we’d better get our robes on.” harry was so busy staring at malfoy he did not notice goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit harry hard on the side of the head. he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning. harry was not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins. eyes still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held. to his relief malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck. harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that hermione and ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. at last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt. goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years punching them aside crabbe and zabini followed. “you go on,” malfoy told pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. “i just want to check something.” pansy left. now harry and malfoy were alone in the compartment. people were filing past descending onto the dark platform. malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster. what had malfoy wanted to hide from pansy was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend “petrificus totalusl” without warning malfoy pointed his wand at harry who was instantly paralyzed. as though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing floor-shaking crash at malfoy’s feet the invisibility cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. he couldn’t move a muscle he could only gaze up at malfoy who smiled broadly. “i thought so,” he said jubilantly. “i heard goyle’s trunk hit you. and i thought i saw something white flash through the air after zabini came back. ...” his eyes lingered for a moment upon harry’s trainers. “you didn’t hear anything i care about potter. but while i’ve got you here ...” and he stamped hard on harry’s face. harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere. “that’s from my father. now let’s see. ...” malfoy dragged the cloak out from under harry’s immobilized body and threw it over him. “i don’t reckon they’ll find you till the train’s back in london,” he said quietly. “see you around potter ... or not.” and taking care to tread on harry’s fingers malfoy left the compartment. snape victorious harry could not move a muscle. he lay there beneath the invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. his immediate thought was that someone surely would check the compartments before the train departed again. but at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard. his best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him. harry had never hated malfoy more than as he lay there like an absurd turtle on its back blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. what a stupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and now the last few footsteps were dying away everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of talk. ron and hermione would think that he had left the train without them. once they arrived at hogwarts and took their places in the great hall looked up and down the gryffindor table a few times and finally realized that he was not there he no doubt would be halfway back to london. he tried to make a sound even a grunt but it was impossible. then he remembered that some wizards like dumbledore could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words “accio wand\” over and over again in his head but nothing happened. he thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the far-off hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where harry potter had gone. a feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage malfoy was riding in where he could be recounting his attack on harry to crabbe goyle zabini and pansy parkinson. the train lurched causing harry to roll over onto his side. now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. the floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. the express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. ... then he felt his invisibility cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said “wotcher harry.” there was a flash of red light and harry’s body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at tonks who was holding the invisibility cloak she had just pulled away. “we’d better get out of here quickly,” she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. “come on we’ll jump.” harry hurried after her into the corridor. she pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view. the cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. silently she handed him back the invisibility cloak. “who did it?” “draco malfoy,” said harry bitterly. “thanks for ... well ...” “no problem,” said tonks without smiling. from what harry could see in the darkness she was as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been when he had met her at the burrow. “i can fix your nose if you stand still.” harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit madam pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to healing spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes. “episkey,” said tonks. harry’s nose felt very hot and then very cold. he raised a hand and felt it gingerly. it seemed to be mended. “thanks a lot!” “you’d better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school,” said tonks still unsmiling. as harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. “was that a patronus?” asked harry who had seen dumbledore send messages like this. “yes i’m sending word to the castle that i’ve got you or they’ll worry. come on we’d better not dawdle.” they set off toward the lane that led to the school. “how did you find me?” “i noticed you hadn’t left the train and i knew you had that cloak. i thought you might be hiding for some reason. when i saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment i thought i’d check.” “but what are you doing here anyway?” harry asked. “i’m stationed in hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection,” said tonks. “is it just you who’s stationed up here or — ” “no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too.” “dawlish that auror dumbledore attacked last year?” “that’s right.” they trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage tracks. harry looked sideways at tonks under his cloak. last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes. now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. was this all the effect of what had happened at the ministry he reflected uncomfortably that hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about sirius to her that it hadn’t been her fault at all but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. he was far from blaming her for sirius’s death it was no more her fault than anyone else’s and much less than his but he did not like talking about sirius if he could avoid it. and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence tonks ’s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them. having always traveled there by carriage harry had never before appreciated just how far hogwarts was from hogsmeade station. with great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar. he was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy tonks behind. but when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut. “alohomora\” he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened. “that won’t work on these,” said tonks. “dumbledore bewitched them himself.” harry looked around. “i could climb a wall,” he suggested. “no you couldn’t,” said tonks flatly. “anti-intruder jinxes on all of them. security’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.” “well then,” said harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness “i suppose i’ll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning.” “someone’s coming down for you,” said tonks. “look.” a lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure filch’s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. it was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them and harry had pulled off his invisibility cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of severus snape. “well well well,” sneered snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. “nice of you to turn up potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.” “i couldn’t change i didn’t have my — ” harry began but snape cut across him. “there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quite — ah — safe in my hands.” “i meant hagrid to get the message,” said tonks frowning. “hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast just like potter here so i took it instead. and incidentally,” said snape standing back to allow harry to pass him “i was interested to see your new patronus.” he shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place. “i think you were better off with the old one,” said snape the malice in his voice unmistakable. “the new one looks weak.” as snape swung the lantern about harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on tonks’s face. then she was covered in darkness once more. “good night,” harry called to her over his shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with snape. “thanks for ... everything.” “see you harry.” snape did not speak for a minute or so. harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that snape could not feel them burning him. he had loathed snape from their first encounter but snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward sirius. whatever dumbledore said harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that snape ’s snide remarks to sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fighting voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in sirius rushing off to the ministry the night that he had died. harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness. “fifty points from gryffindor for lateness i think,” said snape. “and let me see another twenty for your muggle attire. you know i don’t believe any house has ever been in negative figures this early in the term we haven’t even started pudding. you might have set a record potter.” the fury and hatred bubbling inside harry seemed to blaze white-hot but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to london than tell snape why he was late. “i suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you?” snape continued. “and with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.” still harry remained silent though he thought his chest might explode. he knew that snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment harry without anyone else listening. they reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the great hall. harry wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed. as though he had read harry’s mind however snape said “no cloak. you can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted i’m sure.” harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from snape. the great hall with its four long house tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. it was all a shimmering blur to harry however who walked so fast that he was passing the hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted ron and hermione sped along the benches toward them and forced his way in between them. “where’ve you — blimey what’ve you done to your face?” said ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. “why what’s wrong with it?” said harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection. “you’re covered in blood!” said hermione. “come here she raised her wand said “tergeol” and siphoned off the dried blood. “thanks,” said harry feeling his now clean face. “how’s my nose looking?” “normal,” said hermione anxiously. “why shouldn’t it harry what happened we’ve been terrified!” “i’ll tell you later,” said harry curtly. he was very conscious that ginny neville dean and seamus were listening in even nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop. “but — ” said hermione. “not now hermione,” said harry in a darkly significant voice. he hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of death eaters and a dementor. of course malfoy would spread the story as far and wide as he could but there was always a chance it wouldn’t reach too many gryffindor ears. he reached across ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with puddings. “you missed the sorting anyway,” said hermione as ron dived for a large chocolate gateau. “hat say anything interesting?” asked harry taking a piece of treacle tart. “more of the same really ... advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies you know.” “dumbledore mentioned voldemort at all?” “not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast doesn’t he it can’t be long now.” “snape said hagrid was late for the feast — ” “you’ve seen snape how come?” said ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau. “bumped into him,” said harry evasively. “hagrid was only a few minutes late,” said hermione. “look he’s waving at you harry.” harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at hagrid who was indeed waving at him. hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house the top of whose head came up to somewhere between hagrid’s elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. harry was surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on hagrid’s other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. she looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. having always considered her a bit of a fraud harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused lord voldemort to kill harry’s parents and attack harry himself. the knowledge had made him even less eager to find himself in her company but thankfully this year he would be dropping divination. her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the slytherin table. draco malfoy was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides burning again. what he would not give to fight malfoy one-on-one . . . “so what did professor slughorn want?” hermione asked. “to know what really happened at the ministry,” said harry. “him and everyone else here,” sniffed hermione. “people were interrogating us about it on the train weren’t they ron?” “yeah,” said ron. “all wanting to know if you really are ‘the chosen one’ — ” “there has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,” interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. “i am considered something of a potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly. i have assured the spirit community that i will not pester you for information however. ‘harry potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence i told them. ‘i would rather die than betray his trust.’ ” “that’s not saying much seeing as you’re already dead,” ron observed. “once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said nearly headless nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the gryffindor table just as dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. the talk and laughter echoing around the hall died away almost instantly. “the very best of evenings to you!” he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room. “what happened to his hand?” gasped hermione. she was not the only one who had noticed. dumbledore ’s right hand was as blackened and dead looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch harry from the dursleys. whispers swept the room dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury. “nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “now ... to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back! another year full of magical education awaits you ...” “his hand was like that when i saw him over the summer,” harry whispered to hermione. “i thought he’d have cured it by now though ... or madam pomfrey would’ve done.” “it looks as if it’s died,” said hermione with a nauseated expression. “but there are some injuries you can’t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons without antidotes. ...” ... and mr. filch our caretaker has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called weasleys’ wizard wheezes. “those wishing to play for their house quidditch teams should give their names to their heads of house as usual. we are also looking for new quidditch commentators who should do likewise. “we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. professor slughorn” — slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of potions master.” “potions?” “potions?” the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered whether they had heard right. “potions?” said ron and hermione together turning to stare at harry. “but you said — ” “professor snape meanwhile,” said dumbledore raising his voice so that it carried over all the muttering “will be taking over the position of defense against the dark arts teacher.” “no!” said harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. he did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed. how could snape be given the defense against the dark arts job after all this time hadn’t it been widely known for years that dumbledore did not trust him to do it “but harry you said that slughorn was going to be teaching defense against the dark arts!” said hermione. “i thought he was!” said harry racking his brains to remember when dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall dumbledore ever telling him what slughorn would be teaching. snape who was sitting on dumbledore’s right did not stand up at the mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the slytherin table yet harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much. “well there’s one good thing,” he said savagely. “snape ’ll be gone by the end of the year.” “what do you mean?” asked ron. “that job’s jinxed. no one’s lasted more than a year. ... quirrell actually died doing it. ... personally i’m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death. “harry!” said hermione shocked and reproachful. “he might just go back to teaching potions at the end of the year,” said ron reasonably. “that slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term. moody didn’t.” dumbledore cleared his throat. harry ron and hermione were not the only ones who had been talking the whole hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that snape had finally achieved his heart’s desire. seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing. “now as everybody in this hall knows lord voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.” the silence seemed to tauten and strain as dumbledore spoke. harry glanced at malfoy. malfoy was not looking at dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand as though he found the headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention. “i cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of us at hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. the castle’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful ways but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. i urge you therefore to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you however irksome you might find them — in particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours. i implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle to report it to a member of staff immediately. i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others’ safety.” dumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more. “but now your beds await as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish and i know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. let us therefore say good night. pip pip!” with the usual deafening scraping noise the benches were moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the great hall toward their dormitories. harry who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of the gryffindors to draw ahead of him. hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years but ron remained with harry. “what really happened to your nose?” he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the hall and out of earshot of anyone else. harry told him. it was a mark of the strength of their friendship that ron did not laugh. “i saw malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” he said darkly. “yeah well never mind that,” said harry bitterly. “listen to what he was saying before he found out i was there. ...” harry had expected ron to be stunned by malfoy’s boasts. with what harry considered pure pigheadedness however ron was unimpressed. “come on harry he was just showing off for parkinson. ... what kind of mission would you-know who have given him?” “how d’you know voldemort doesn’t need someone at hogwarts it wouldn’t be the first — ” “i wish yeh’d stop sayin’ tha’ name harry,” said a reproachful voice behind them. harry looked over his shoulder to see hagrid shaking his head. “dumbledore uses that name,” said harry stubbornly. “yeah well tha’s dumbledore innit?” said hagrid mysteriously. “so how come yeh were late harry i was worried.” “got held up on the train,” said harry. “why were you late?” “i was with grawp,” said hagrid happily. “los’ track o’ the time. he’s got a new home up in the mountains now dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave. he’s much happier than he was in the forest. we were havin’ a good chat.” “really?” said harry taking care not to catch ron’s eye the last time he had met hagrid’s half-brother a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots his vocabulary had comprised five words two of which he was unable to pronounce properly. “oh yeah he’s really come on,” said hagrid proudly. “yeh’ll be amazed. i’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as me assistant.” ron snorted loudly but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. they were now standing beside the oak front doors. “anyway i’ll see yeh tomorrow firs’ lesson’s straight after lunch. come early an’ yeh can say hello ter buck — i mean witherwings!” raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the front doors into the darkness. harry and ron looked at each other. harry could tell that ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself. “you’re not taking care of magical creatures are you?” ron shook his head. “and you’re not either are you?” harry shook his head too. “and hermione,” said ron “she’s not is she?” harry shook his head again. exactly what hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject he did not like to think. 9 the half-blood prince harry and ron met hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. hoping for some support for his theory harry lost no time in telling hermione what he had overheard malfoy saying on the hogwarts express. “but he was obviously showing off for parkinson wasn’t he?” interjected ron quickly before hermione could say anything. “well,” she said uncertainly “i don’t know. ... it would be like malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is ... but that’s a big lie to tell. ...” “exactly,” said harry but he could not press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands. “it’s rude to point,” ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. the boy who had been muttering something about harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. ron sniggered. “i love being a sixth year. and we’re going to be getting free time this year. whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.” “we’re going to need that time for studying ron!” said hermione as they set off down the corridor. “yeah but not today,” said ron. “today’s going to be a real doss i reckon.” “hold it!” said hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. “fanged frisbees are banned hand it over,” she told him sternly. the scowling boy handed over the snarling frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends. ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the frisbee from hermione ’s grip. “excellent i’ve always wanted one of these.” hermione ’s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle lavender brown had apparently found ron’s remark highly amusing. she continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at ron over her shoulder. ron looked rather pleased with himself. the ceiling of the great hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. while they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon harry and ron told hermione about their embarrassing conversation with hagrid the previous evening. “but he can’t really think we’d continue care of magical creatures!” she said looking distressed. “i mean when has any of us expressed ... you know ... any enthusiasm?” “that’s it though innit?” said ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole. “we were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like hagrid. but he thinks we liked the stupid subject d’you reckon anyone’s going to go on to n.e.w.t.?” neither harry nor hermione answered there was no need. they knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue care of magical creatures. they avoided hagrid’s eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later. after they had eaten they remained in their places awaiting professor mcgonagall’s descent from the staff table. the distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for professor mcgonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary o.w.l. grades to continue with their chosen n.e.w.t.s. hermione was immediately cleared to continue with charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration herbology arithmancy ancient runes and potions and shot off to a first-period ancient runes class without further ado. neville took a little longer to sort out his round face was anxious as professor mcgonagall looked down his application and then consulted his o.w.l. results. “herbology fine,” she said. “professor sprout will be delighted to see you back with an ‘outstanding’ o.w.l. and you qualify for defense against the dark arts with ‘exceeds expectations.’ but the problem is transfiguration. i’m sorry longbottom but an acceptable’ really isn’t good enough to continue to n.e.w.t level. i just don’t think you’d be able to cope with the coursework.” neville hung his head. professor mcgonagall peered at him through her square spectacles. “why do you want to continue with transfiguration anyway i’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.” neville looked miserable and muttered something about “my grandmother wants.” “hmph,” snorted professor mcgonagall. “it’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she’s got rather than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after what happened at the ministry.” neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly professor mcgonagall had never paid him a compliment before. “i’m sorry longbottom but i cannot let you into my n.e.w.t. class. i see that you have an ‘exceeds expectations’ in charms however — why not try for a n.e.w.t. in charms?” “my grandmother thinks charms is a soft option,” mumbled neville. “take charms,” said professor mcgonagall “and i shall drop augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her charms o.w.l. the subject is not necessarily worthless.” smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on neville’s face professor mcgonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying details of his new classes to neville. professor mcgonagall turned next to parvati patil whose first question was whether firenze the handsome centaur was still teaching divination. “he and professor trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,” said professor mcgonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination. “the sixth year is being taken by professor trelawney.” parvati set off for divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen. “so potter potter ...” said professor mcgonagall consulting her notes as she turned to harry. “charms defense against the dark arts herbology transfiguration ... all fine. i must say i was pleased with your transfiguration mark potter very pleased. now why haven’t you applied to continue with potions i thought it was your ambition to become an auror?” “it was but you told me i had to get an ‘outstanding’ in my o.w.l. professor.” “and so you did when professor snape was teaching the subject. professor slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept n.e.w.t students with ‘exceeds expectations’ at o.w.l. do you wish to proceed with potions?” “yes,” said harry “but i didn’t buy the books or any ingredients or anything — ” “i’m sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some,” said professor mcgonagall. “very well potter here is your schedule. oh by the way — twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the gryffindor quidditch team. i shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.” a few minutes later ron was cleared to do the same subjects as harry and the two of them left the table together. “look,” said ron delightedly gazing at his schedule “we’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after break ... and after lunch ... excellent.” they returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including katie bell the only remaining member of the original gryffindor quidditch team that harry had joined in his first year. “i thought you’d get that well done,” she called over pointing at the captain’s badge on harry’s chest. “tell me when you call trials!” “don’t be stupid,” said harry “you don’t need to try out i’ve watched you play for five years. ...” “you mustn’t start off like that,” she said warningly. “for all you know there’s someone much better than me out there. good teams have been ruined before now because captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends. ...” ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the fanged frisbee hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. it zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. crookshanks’s yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close. an hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the defense against the dark arts classroom four floors below. hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon. “we got so much homework for runes,” she said anxiously when harry and ron joined her. “a fifteen inch essay two translations and i’ve got to read these by wednesday!” “shame,” yawned ron. “you wait,” she said resentfully. “i bet snape gives us loads.” the classroom door opened as she spoke and snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. silence fell over the queue immediately. “inside,” he said. harry looked around as they entered. snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight. new pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures. “i have not asked you to take out your books,” said snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk hermione hastily dropped her copy of confronting the faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. “i wish to speak to you and i want your fullest attention.” his black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on harry’s than anyone else’s. “you have had five teachers in this subject so far i believe.” you believe ... like you haven’t watched them all come and go snape hoping you’d be next thought harry scathingly. “naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. given this confusion i am surprised so many of you scraped an o.w.l. in this subject. i shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the n.e.w.t. work which will be much more advanced.” snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their necks to keep him in view. “the dark arts,” said snape “are many varied ever changing and eternal. fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. you are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible.” harry stared at snape. it was surely one thing to respect the dark arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as snape was doing with a loving caress in his voice “your defenses,” said snape a little louder “must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. these pictures” — he indicated a few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse” — he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the dementor’s kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed slumped against a wall — “or provoke the aggression of the inferius” — a bloody mass upon the ground. “has an inferius been seen then?” said parvati patil in a high-pitched voice. “is it definite is he using them?” “the dark lord has used inferi in the past,” said snape “which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. now ...” he set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him. ... you are i believe complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. what is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?” hermione’s hand shot into the air. snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly “very well — miss granger?” “your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to perform,” said hermione “which gives you a split-second advantage.” “an answer copied almost word for word from the standard book of spells grade six,” said snape dismissively over in the corner malfoy sniggered “but correct in essentials. yes those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. not all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some” — his gaze lingered maliciously upon harry once more — “lack.” harry knew snape was thinking of their disastrous occlumency lessons of the previous year. he refused to drop his gaze but glowered at snape until snape looked away. “you will now divide,” snape went on “into pairs. one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. the other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. carry on.” although snape did not know it harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the d.a. how to perform a shield charm the previous year. none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however. a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. typically ten minutes into the lesson hermione managed to repel neville’s muttered jelly-legs jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought harry bitterly but which snape ignored. he swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch harry and ron struggling with the task. ron who was supposed to be jinxing harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come. “pathetic weasley,” said snape after a while. “here — let me show you — ” he turned his wand on harry so fast that harry reacted instinctively all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten he yelled “protegol” his shield charm was so strong snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. the whole class had looked around and now watched as snape righted himself scowling. “do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells potter?” “yes,” said harry stiffly. “yes sir.” “there’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ professor.” the words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. several people gasped including hermione. behind snape however ron dean and seamus grinned appreciatively. “detention saturday night my office,” said snape. “i do not take cheek from anyone potter ... not even ‘the chosen one. ’ ” “that was brilliant harry!” chortled ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later. “you really shouldn’t have said it,” said hermione frowning at ron. “what made you?” “he tried to jinx me in case you didn’t notice!” fumed harry. “i had enough of that during those occlumency lessons! why doesn’t he use another guinea pig for a change what’s dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach defense did you hear him talking about the dark arts he loves them! all that unfixed indestructible stuff — ” “well,” said hermione “i thought he sounded a bit like you.” “like me?” “yes when you were telling us what it’s like to face voldemort. you said it wasn’t just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your guts — well wasn’t that what snape was saying that it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?” harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as the standard book of spells that he did not argue. “harry! hey harry!” harry looked around jack sloper one of the beaters on last year’s gryffindor quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment. “for you,” panted sloper. “listen i heard you’re the new captain. when’re you holding trials?” “i’m not sure yet,” said harry thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. “i’ll let you know.” “oh right. i was hoping it’d be this weekend — ” but harry was not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment. leaving sloper in mid-sentence he hurried away with ron and hermione unrolling the parchment as he went. dear harry i would like to start our private lessons this saturday. kindly come along to my office at 8 p.m. i hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. yours sincerely albus dumbledore p. s. i enjoy acid pops. “he enjoys acid pops?” said ron who had read the message over harry’s shoulder and was looking perplexed. “it’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,” said harry in a low voice. “ha! snape’s not going to be pleased. ... i won’t be able to do his detention!” he ron and hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what dumbledore would teach harry. ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the death eaters would not know. hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that dumbledore wanted to teach harry advanced defensive magic. after break she went off to arithmancy while harry and ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started snape’s homework. this turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period though she considerably speeded up the process). they had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon’s double potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been snape’s. when they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to n.e.w.t. level. crabbe and goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required o.w.l. grade but four slytherins had made it through including malfoy. four ravenclaws were there and one hufflepuff ernie macmillan whom harry liked despite his rather pompous manner. “harry,” ernie said portentously holding out his hand as harry approached “didn’t get a chance to speak in defense against the dark arts this morning. good lesson i thought but shield charms are old hat of course for us old d.a. lags ... and how are you ron — hermione?” before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon door opened and slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door. as they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted harry and zabini with particular enthusiasm. the dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells. harry ron and hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons. the four slytherins took a table together as did the four ravenclaws. this left harry ron and hermione to share a table with ernie. they chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents harry had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow. he found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at ron who grinned back lazily. “now then now then now then,” said slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. “scales out everyone and potion kits and don’t forget your copies of advanced potion-making. ...” “sir?” said harry raising his hand. “harry m’boy?” “i haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s ron — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the n.e.w.t. you see — ” “ah yes professor mcgonagall did mention ... not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all. you can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and i’m sure we can lend you some scales and we’ve got a small stock of old books here they’ll do until you can write to flourish and blotts. ...” slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a moment’s foraging emerged with two very battered looking copies of advanced potion-making by libatius borage which he gave to harry and ron along with two sets of tarnished scales. “now then,” said slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off “i’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know. these are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your n.e.w.t.s. you ought to have heard of ’em even if you haven’t made ’em yet. anyone tell me what this one is?” he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table. harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it. hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s slughorn pointed at her. “it’s veritaserum a colorless odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth,” said hermione. “very good very good!” said slughorn happily. “now,” he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the ravenclaw table “this one here is pretty well known. ... featured in a few ministry leaflets lately too ... who can — ” hermione’s hand was fastest once more. “it’s polyjuice potion sir,” she said. harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling mudlike substance in the second cauldron but did not resent hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year. “excellent excellent! now this one here ... yes my dear?” said slughorn now looking slightly bemused as hermione’s hand punched the air again. “it’s amortentia!” “it is indeed. it seems almost foolish to ask,” said slughorn who was looking mightily impressed “but i assume you know what it does?” “it’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said hermione. “quite right! you recognized it i suppose by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?” “and the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said hermione enthusiastically “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of us according to what attracts us and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and — ” but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence. “may i ask your name my dear?” said slughorn ignoring hermione’s embarrassment. “hermione granger sir.” “granger granger can you possibly be related to hector dagworth-granger who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers?” “no i don’t think so sir. i’m muggle-born you see.” harry saw malfoy lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from hermione to harry who was sitting next to her. “oho! ‘one of my best friends is muggle-born and she’s the best in our yeah’ i’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke harry?” “yes sir,” said harry. “well well take twenty well-earned points for gryffindor miss granger,” said slughorn genially. malfoy looked rather as he had done the time hermione had punched him in the face. hermione turned to harry with a radiant expression and whispered “did you really tell him i’m the best in the year oh harry!” “well what’s so impressive about that?” whispered ron who for some reason looked annoyed. “you are the best in the year — i’d’ve told him so if he’d asked me!” hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture so that they could hear what slughorn was saying. ron looked slightly disgruntled. “amortentia doesn’t really create love of course. it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. no this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. it is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room — oh yes,” he said nodding gravely at malfoy and nott both of whom were smirking skeptically. “when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. ... “and now,” said slughorn “it is time for us to start work.” “sir you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on slughorn ’s desk. the potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled. “oho,” said slughorn again. harry was sure that slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. “yes. that. well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called felix felicis. i take it,” he turned smiling to look at hermione who had let out an audible gasp “that you know what felix felicis does miss granger?” “it’s liquid luck,” said hermione excitedly. “it makes you lucky!” the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. now all harry could see of malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving slughorn his full and undivided attention. “quite right take another ten points for gryffindor. yes it’s a funny little potion felix felicis,” said slughorn. “desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong. however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.” “why don’t people drink it all the time sir?” said terry boot eagerly. “because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence,” said slughorn. “too much of a good thing you know ... highly toxic in large quantities. but taken sparingly and very occasionally ...” “have you ever taken it sir?” asked michael corner with great interest. “twice in my life,” said slughorn. “once when i was twenty-four once when i was fifty-seven. two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. two perfect days.” he gazed dreamily into the distance. whether he was playacting or not thought harry the effect was good. “and that,” said slughorn apparently coming back to earth “is what i shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.” there was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold. “one tiny bottle of felix felicis,” said slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. “enough for twelve hours’ luck. from dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt. “now i must give you warning that felix felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events for instance examinations or elections. so the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary! “so,” said slughorn suddenly brisk “how are you to win my fabulous prize well by turning to page ten of advanced potion-making. we have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the draught of living death. i know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and i do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. the person who does best however will win little felix here. off you go!” there was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales but nobody spoke. the concentration within the room was almost tangible. harry saw malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of advanced potion-making. it could not have been clearer that malfoy really wanted that lucky day. harry bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him. to his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. as he dashed back to his cauldron he saw malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could. everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of potions that it was hard to keep your work private. within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam. hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest. her potion already resembled the “smooth black currant-colored liquid” mentioned as the ideal halfway stage. having finished chopping his roots harry bent low over his book again. it was really very irritating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting. “sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas malfoy?” harry looked up slughorn was just passing the slytherin table. “yes,” said slughorn without looking at malfoy “i was sorry to hear he had died although of course it wasn’t unexpected dragon pox at his age. ...” and he walked away. harry bent back over his cauldron smirking. he could tell that malfoy had expected to be treated like harry or zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from snape. it looked as though malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of felix felicis. the sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. harry turned to hermione. “can i borrow your silver knife?” she nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now. harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. to his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook. his annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. according to the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. according to the addition the previous owner had made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. could the old owner be right twice harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise. the effect was immediate. the potion turned palest pink. “how are you doing that?” demanded hermione who was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple. “add a clockwise stir — ” “no no the book says counterclockwise!” she snapped. harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause ... seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise ... across the table ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice. harry glanced around. as far as he could see no one else’s potion had turned as pale as his. he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon. “and time’s ... up!” called slughorn. “stop stirring please!” slughorn moved slowly among the tables peering into cauldrons. he made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. at last he reached the table where harry ron hermione and ernie were sitting. he smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in ron’s cauldron. he passed over ernie’s navy concoction. hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. then he saw harry’s and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face. “the clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “excellent excellent harry! good lord it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. she was a dab hand at potions lily was! here you are then here you are — one bottle of felix felicis as promised and use it well!” harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the slytherins’ faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on hermione’s. ron looked simply dumbfounded. “how did you do that?” he whispered to harry as they left the dungeon. “got lucky i suppose,” said harry because malfoy was within earshot. once they were securely ensconced at the gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them. hermione’s face became stonier with every word he uttered. “i s’pose you think i cheated?” he finished aggravated by her expression. “well it wasn’t exactly your own work was it?” she said stiffly. “he only followed different instructions to ours,” said ron. “could’ve been a catastrophe couldn’t it but he took a risk and it paid off.” he heaved a sigh. “slughorn could’ve handed me that book but no i get the one no one’s ever written on. puked on by the look of page fifty-two but — ” “hang on,” said a voice close by harry’s left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in slughorn’s dungeon. he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them. “did i hear right you’ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book harry?” she looked alarmed and angry. harry knew what was on her mind at once. “it’s nothing,” he said reassuringly lowering his voice. “it’s not like you know riddle’s diary. it’s just an old textbook someone’s scribbled on.” “but you’re doing what it says?” “i just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly ginny there’s nothing funny — ” “ginny’s got a point,” said hermione perking up at once. “we ought to check that there’s nothing odd about it. i mean all these funny instructions who knows?” “hey!” said harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of advanced potion-making out of his bag and raised her wand. “ specialis revelio\” she said rapping it smartly on the front cover. nothing whatsoever happened. the book simply lay there looking old and dirty and dog-eared. “finished?” said harry irritably. “or d’you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?” “it seems all right,” said hermione still staring at the book suspiciously. “i mean it really does seem to be ... just a textbook.” “good. then i’ll have it back,” said harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. nobody else was looking. harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of felix felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs. this book is the property of the half-blood prince. 10 the house of gaunt for the rest of the week’s potions lessons harry continued to follow the half-blood prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from libatius borage’s with the result that by their fourth lesson slughorn was raving about harry’s abilities saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. neither ron nor hermione was delighted by this. although harry had offered to share his book with both of them ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than harry did and could not keep asking harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. hermione meanwhile was resolutely plowing on with what she called the “official” instructions but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the prince’s. harry wondered vaguely who the half-blood prince had been. although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of advanced potion-making he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the prince had not made additional notes not all of them concerned with potion-making. here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the prince had made up himself. “or herself,” said hermione irritably overhearing harry pointing some of these out to ron in the common room on saturday evening. “it might have been a girl. i think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.” “the half-blood prince he was called,” harry said. “how many girls have been princes?” hermione seemed to have no answer to this. she merely scowled and twitched her essay on the principles of re materialization away from ron who was trying to read it upside down. harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of advanced potion-making back into his bag. “it’s five to eight i’d better go i’ll be late for dumbledore.” “ooooh!” gasped hermione looking up at once. “good luck! we’ll wait up we want to hear what he teaches you!” “hope it goes okay,” said ron and the pair of them watched harry leave through the portrait hole. harry proceeded through deserted corridors though he had to step hastily behind a statue when professor trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards reading them as she walked. “two of spades conflict,” she murmured as she passed the place where harry crouched hidden. “seven of spades an ill omen. ten of spades violence. knave of spades a dark young man possibly troubled one who dislikes the questioner — ” she stopped dead right on the other side of harry’s statue. “well that can’t be right,” she said annoyed and harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall. “acid pops,” said harry and the gargoyle leapt aside the wall behind it slid apart and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed onto which harry stepped so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to dumbledore’s office. harry knocked. “come in,” said dumbledore’s voice. “good evening sir,” said harry walking into the headmaster’s office. “ah good evening harry. sit down,” said dumbledore smiling. “i hope you’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?” “yes thanks sir,” said harry. “you must have been busy a detention under your belt already!” “er,” began harry awkwardly but dumbledore did not look too stern. “i have arranged with professor snape that you will do your detention next saturday instead.” “right,” said harry who had more pressing matters on his mind than s nape’s detention and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. the circular office looked just as it always did the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables puffing smoke and whirring portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames and dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix fawkes stood on his perch behind the door watching harry with bright interest. it did not even look as though dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. “so harry,” said dumbledore in a businesslike voice. “you have been wondering i am sure what i have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons?” “yes sir.” “well i have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted lord voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago for you to be given certain information.” there was a pause. “you said at the end of last term you were going to tell me everything,” said harry. it was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. “sir,” he added. “and so i did,” said dumbledore placidly. “i told you everything i know. from this point forth we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. from here on in harry i may be as woefully wrong as humphrey belcher who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.” “but you think you’re right?” said harry. “naturally i do but as i have already proven to you i make mistakes like the next man. in fact being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” “sir,” said harry tentatively “does what you’re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy will it help me . . . survive?” “it has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said dumbledore as casually as if harry had asked him about the next day’s weather “and i certainly hope that it will help you to survive.” dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk past harry who turned eagerly in his seat to watch dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. when dumbledore straightened up he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. he placed the pensieve on the desk in front of harry. “you look worried.” harry had indeed been eyeing the pensieve with some apprehension. his previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories though highly instructive had also been uncomfortable. the last time he had disturbed its contents he had seen much more than he would have wished. but dumbledore was smiling. “this time you enter the pensieve with me ... and even more unusually with permission.” “where are we going sir?” “for a trip down bob ogden’s memory lane,” said dumbledore pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery white substance. “who was bob ogden?” “he was employed by the department of magical law enforcement,” said dumbledore. “he died some time ago but not before i had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. we are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. if you will stand harry ...” but dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle his injured hand seemed stiff and painful. “shall — shall i sir?” “no matter harry — ” dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out. “sir — how did you injure your hand?” harry asked again looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity. “now is not the moment for that story harry. not yet. we have an appointment with bob ogden.” dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the pensieve where they swirled and shimmered neither liquid nor gas. “after you,” said dumbledore gesturing toward the bowl. harry bent forward took a deep breath and plunged his face into the silvery substance. he felt his feet leave the office floor he was falling falling through whirling darkness and then quite suddenly he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. before his eyes had adjusted dumbledore landed beside him. they were standing in a country lane bordered by high tangled hedgerows beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. some ten feet in front of them stood a short plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. he was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. harry knew this must be ogden he was the only person in sight and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like muggles in this case a frock coat and spats over a striped one piece bathing costume. before harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. dumbledore and harry followed. as they passed the wooden sign harry looked up at its two arms. the one pointing back the way they had come read great hangleton 5 miles. the arm pointing after ogden said little hangleton 1 mile. they walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing frock-coated figure ahead. then the lane curved to the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that they had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. harry could see a village undoubtedly little hangleton nestled between two steep hills its church and graveyard clearly visible. across the valley set on the opposite hillside was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. dumbledore lengthened his stride and harry hurried to keep up. he thought little hangleton must be their final destination and wondered as he had done on the night they had found slughorn why they had to approach it from such a distance. he soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village however. the lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner it was to see the very edge of ogden’s frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. dumbledore and harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. the path was crooked rocky and potholed sloping downhill like the last one and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. sure enough the track soon opened up at the copse and dumbledore and harry came to a halt behind ogden who had stopped and drawn his wand. despite the cloudless sky the old trees ahead cast deep dark cool shadows and it was a few seconds before harry’s eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. it seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby blocking all light and the view of the valley below. he wondered whether it was inhabited its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. nettles grew all around it their tips reaching the windows which were tiny and thick with grime. just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there however one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it as though somebody was cooking. ogden moved forward quietly and it seemed to harry rather cautiously. as the dark shadows of the trees slid over him he stopped again staring at the front door to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. then there was a rustle and a crack and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree landing on his feet right in front of ogden who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. “ you’re not welcome.” the man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. several of his teeth were missing. his eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. he might have looked comical but he did not the effect was frightening and harry could not blame ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. “er — good morning. i’m from the ministry of magic “ you’re not welcome.” “er — i’m sorry — i don’t understand you,” said ogden nervously. harry thought ogden was being extremely dim the stranger was making himself very clear in harry’s opinion particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. “you understand him i’m sure harry?” said dumbledore quietly. “yes of course,” said harry slightly nonplussed. “why can’t ogden — ” but as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again he suddenly understood. “he’s speaking parseltongue?” “very good,” said dumbledore nodding and smiling. the man in rags was now advancing on ogden knife in one hand wand in the other. “now look — ” ogden began but too late there was a bang and ogden was on the ground clutching his nose while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. “morfin!” said a loud voice. an elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. this man was shorter than the first and oddly proportioned his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong which with his bright brown eyes short scrubby hair and wrinkled face gave him the look of a powerful aged monkey. he came to a halt beside the man with the knife who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of ogden on the ground. “ministry is it?” said the older man looking down at ogden. “correct!” said ogden angrily dabbing his face. “and you i take it are mr. gaunt?” “s’right,” said gaunt. “got you in the face did he?” “yes he did!” snapped ogden. “should’ve made your presence known shouldn’t you?” said gaunt aggressively. “this is private property. can’t just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.” “defend himself against what man?” said ogden clambering back to his feet. “busybodies. intruders. muggles and filth.” ogden pointed his wand at his own nose which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus and the flow stopped at once. mr. gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to morfin. “get in the house. don’t argue.” this time ready for it harry recognized parseltongue even while he could understand what was being said he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all ogden could hear. morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again. “it’s your son i’m here to see mr. gaunt,” said ogden as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. “that was morfin wasn’t it?” “ar that was morfin,” said the old man indifferently. “are you pure-blood?” he asked suddenly aggressive. “that’s neither here nor there,” said ogden coldly and harry felt his respect for ogden rise. apparently gaunt felt rather differently. he squinted into ogden’s face and muttered in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone “now i come to think about it i’ve seen noses like yours down in the village.” “i don’t doubt it if your son’s been let loose on them,” said ogden. “perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?” “inside?” “yes mr. gaunt. i’ve already told you. i’m here about morfin. we sent an owl — ” “i’ve no use for owls,” said gaunt. “i don’t open letters.” “then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,” said ogden tartly. “i am here following a serious breach of wizarding law which occurred here in the early hours of this morning — ” “all right all right all right!” bellowed gaunt. “come in the bleeding house then and much good it’ll do you!” the house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. two doors led off the main room which served as kitchen and living room combined. morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in parseltongue hissy hissy little snakey slither on the floor you be good to morfin or hell nail you to the door. there was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window and harry realized that there was somebody else in the room a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. she was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain pale rather heavy face. her eyes like her brother’s stared in opposite directions. she looked a little cleaner than the two men but harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. “m’daughter merope,” said gaunt grudgingly as ogden looked inquiringly toward her. “good morning,” said ogden. she did not answer but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. “well mr. gaunt,” said ogden “to get straight to the point we have reason to believe that your son morfin performed magic in front of a muggle late last night.” there was a deafening clang. merope had dropped one of the pots. “pick it up\” gaunt bellowed at her. “that’s it grub on the floor like some filthy muggle what’s your wand for you useless sack of muck?” “mr. gaunt please!” said ogden in a shocked voice as merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two. morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. gaunt screamed “mend it you pointless lump mend it!” merope stumbled across the room but before she had time to raise her wand ogden had lifted his own and said firmly “reparo.” the pot mended itself instantly. gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at ogden but seemed to think better of it instead he jeered at his daughter “lucky the nice man from the ministry’s here isn’t it perhaps he’ll take you off my hands perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty squibs. ...” without looking at anybody or thanking ogden merope picked up the pot and returned it hands trembling to its shelf. she then stood quite still her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish. “mr. gaunt,” ogden began again “as i’ve said the reason for my visit — ” “i heard you the first time!” snapped gaunt. “and so what morfin gave a muggle a bit of what was coming to him — what about it then?” “morfin has broken wizarding law,” said ogden sternly. “ ‘morfin has broken wizarding law.’ ” gaunt imitated ogden’s voice making it pompous and singsong. morfin cackled again. “he taught a filthy muggle a lesson that’s illegal now is it?” “yes,” said ogden. “i’m afraid it is.” he pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it. “what’s that then his sentence?” said gaunt his voice rising angrily. “it is a summons to the ministry for a hearing — ” “summons! summons who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere?” “i’m head of the magical law enforcement squad,” said ogden. “and you think we’re scum do you?” screamed gaunt advancing on ogden now with a dirty yellow nailed finger pointing at his chest. “scum who’ll come running when the ministry tells ’em to do you know who you’re talking to you filthy little mudblood do you “i was under the impression that i was speaking to mr. gaunt,” said ogden looking wary but standing his ground. “that’s right!” roared gaunt. for a moment harry thought gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture but then realized that he was showing ogden the ugly black stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger waving it before ogden’s eyes. “see this see this know what it is know where it came from centuries it’s been in our family that’s how far back we go and pure-blood all the way! know how much i’ve been offered for this with the peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?” “i’ve really no idea,” said ogden blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose “and it’s quite beside the point mr. gaunt. your son has committed with a howl of rage gaunt ran toward his daughter. for a split second harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat next moment he was dragging her toward ogden by a gold chain around her neck. “see this?” he bellowed at ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while merope spluttered and gasped for breath. “i see it i see it!” said ogden hastily. “slytherin’sl” yelled gaunt. “salazar slytherin’s! we’re his last living descendants what do you say to that eh?” “mr. gaunt your daughter!” said ogden in alarm but gaunt had already released merope she staggered away from him back to her corner massaging her neck and gulping for air. “so!” said gaunt triumphantly as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. “don’t you go talking to us as if we’re dirt on your shoes! generations of purebloods wizards all — more than you can say i don’t doubt!” and he spat on the floor at ogden’s feet. morfin cackled again. merope huddled beside the window her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair said nothing. “mr. gaunt,” said ogden doggedly “i am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. i am here because of morfin morfin and the muggle he accosted late last night. our information” — he glanced down at his scroll of parchment — “is that morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said muggle causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.” morfin giggled. “ be quiet boy,” snarled gaunt in parseltongue and morfin fell silent again. “and so what if he did then?” gaunt said defiantly to ogden. “i expect you’ve wiped the muggle ’s filthy face clean for him and his memory to boot — ” “that’s hardly the point is it mr. gaunt?” said ogden. “this was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless — ” “ar i had you marked out as a muggle-lover the moment i saw you,” sneered gaunt and he spat on the floor again. “this discussion is getting us nowhere,” said ogden firmly. “it is clear from your son’s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.” he glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. “morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of september to answer the charges of using magic in front of a muggle and causing harm and distress to that same mugg — ” ogden broke off. the jingling clopping sounds of horses and loud laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. gaunt froze listening his eyes wide. morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds his expression hungry. merope raised her head. her face harry saw was starkly white. “my god what an eyesore!” rang out a girl’s voice as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. “couldn’t your father have that hovel cleared away tom?” “it’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice. “everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called gaunt and his children. the son’s quite mad you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village — ” the girl laughed. the jingling clopping noises were growing louder and louder. morfin made to get out of his armchair. “keep your seat,” said his father warningly in parseltongue. “tom,” said the girl’s voice again now so close they were clearly right beside the house “i might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?” “good lord you’re right!” said the man’s voice. “that’ll be the son i told you he’s not right in the head. don’t look at it cecilia darling.” the jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again. “ ‘darling,’ ” whispered morfin in parseltongue looking at his sister. “ ‘darling,’ he called her. so he wouldn’t have you anyway.” merope was so white harry felt sure she was going to faint. “what’s that?” said gaunt sharply also in parseltongue looking from his son to his daughter. “ what did you say morfin?” “she likes looking at that muggle,” said morfin a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister who now looked terrified. “always in the garden when he passes peering through the hedge at him isn’t she and last night — ” merope shook her head jerkily imploringly but morfin went on ruthlessly “hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home wasn’t she?” “hanging out of the window to look at a muggle?” said gaunt quietly. all three of the gaunts seemed to have forgotten ogden who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping. “is it true?” said gaunt in a deadly voice advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. “my daughter — pure-blooded descendant of salazar slytherin — hankering after a filthy dirt-veined muggle?” merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak. “but i got him fathea” cackled morfin. “i got him as he went by and he didn’t look so pretty with hives all over him did he merope?” “you disgusting little squib you filthy little blood traitoa.” roared gaunt losing control and his hands closed around his daughter’s throat. both harry and ogden yelled “no!” at the same time ogden raised his wand and cried “relashiol” gaunt was thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. with a roar of rage morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at ogden brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. ogden ran for his life. dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and harry obeyed merope ’s screams echoing in his ears. ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane his arms over his head where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome dark-haired young man. both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of ogden who bounced off the horse’s flank and set off again his frock coat flying covered from head to foot in dust running pell-mell up the lane. “i think that will do harry,” said dumbledore. he took harry by the elbow and tugged. next moment they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness until they landed squarely on their feet back in dumbledore ’s now twilit office. “what happened to the girl in the cottage?” said harry at once as dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. “merope or whatever her name was?” “oh she survived,” said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that harry should sit down too. “ogden apparated back to the ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the wizengamot. morfin who already had a record of muggle attacks was sentenced to three years in azkaban. marvolo who had injured several ministry employees in addition to ogden received six months.” “marvolo?” harry repeated wonderingly. “that’s right,” said dumbledore smiling in approval. “i am glad to see you’re keeping up.” “that old man was — ” “voldemort’s grandfather yes,” said dumbledore. “marvolo his son morfin and his daughter merope were the last of the gaunts a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before marvolo was born. he as you saw was left in squalor and poverty with a very nasty temper a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son and rather more than his daughter.” “so merope,” said harry leaning forward in his chair and staring at dumbledore “so merope was ... sir does that mean she was ... voldemort’s mother?” “it does,” said dumbledore. “and it so happens that we also had a glimpse of voldemort’s father. i wonder whether you noticed?” “the muggle morfin attacked the man on the horse?” “very good indeed,” said dumbledore beaming. “yes that was tom riddle senior the handsome muggle who used to go riding past the gaunt cottage and for whom merope gaunt cherished a secret burning passion.” “and they ended up married?” harry said in disbelief unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. “i think you are forgetting,” said dumbledore “that merope was a witch. i do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. once marvolo and morfin were safely in azkaban once she was alone and free for the first time in her life then i am sure she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years. “can you not think of any measure merope could have taken to make tom riddle forget his muggle companion and fall in love with her instead?” “the imperius curse?” harry suggested. “or a love potion?” “very good. personally i am inclined to think that she used a love potion. i am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and i do not think it would have been very difficult some hot day when riddle was riding alone to persuade him to take a drink of water. in any case within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed the village of little hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. you can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire’s son ran off with the tramp’s daughter merope. “but the villagers’ shock was nothing to marvolo’s. he returned from azkaban expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell explaining what she had done. “from all that i have been able to discover he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. the shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. azkaban had greatly weakened marvolo and he did not live to see morfin return to the cottage.” “and merope she ... she died didn’t she wasn’t voldemort brought up in an orphanage?” “yes indeed,” said dumbledore. “we must do a certain amount of guessing here although i do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. you see within a few months of their runaway marriage tom riddle reappeared at the manor house in little hangleton without his wife. the rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’ what he meant i am sure is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted though i daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. when they heard what he was saying however the villagers guessed that merope had lied to tom riddle pretending that she was going to have his baby and that he had married her for this reason.” “but she did have his baby.” “but not until a year after they were married. tom riddle left her while she was still pregnant.” “what went wrong?” asked harry. “why did the love potion stop working?” “again this is guesswork,” said dumbledore “but i believe that merope who was deeply in love with her husband could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. i believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. perhaps besotted as she was she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby’s sake. if so she was wrong on both counts. he left her never saw her again and never troubled to discover what became of his son.” the sky outside was inky black and the lamps in dumbledore ’s office seemed to glow more brightly than before. “i think that will do for tonight harry,” said dumbledore after a moment or two. “yes sir,” said harry. he got to his feet but did not leave. “sir ... is it important to know all this about voldemort’s past?” “very important i think,” said dumbledore. “and it ... it’s got something to do with the prophecy?” “it has everything to do with the prophecy.” “right,” said harry a little confused but reassured all the same. he turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again. “sir am i allowed to tell ron and hermione everything you’ve told me?” dumbledore considered him for a moment then said “yes i think mr. weasley and miss granger have proved themselves trustworthy. but harry i am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. it would not be a good idea if word got around how much i know or suspect about lord voldemort’s secrets.” “no sir i’ll make sure it’s just ron and hermione. good night.” he turned away again and was almost at the door when he saw it. sitting on one of the little spindle legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments was an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone. “sir,” said harry staring at it. “that ring — ” “yes?” said dumbledore. “you were wearing it when we visited professor slughorn that night.” “so i was,” dumbledore agreed. “but isn’t it ... sir isn’t it the same ring marvolo gaunt showed ogden?” dumbledore bowed his head. “the very same.” “but how come —  have you always had it?” “no i acquired it very recently,” said dumbledore. “a few days before i came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle’s in fact.” “that would be around the time you injured your hand then sir?” “around that time yes harry.” harry hesitated. dumbledore was smiling. “sir how exactly — ” “too late harry! you shall hear the story another time. good night.” “good night sir.” hermione’s helping hand as hermione had predicted the sixth years’ free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation ron had anticipated but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. not only were they studying as though they had exams every day but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. harry barely understood half of what professor mcgonagall said to them these days even hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. incredibly and to hermione ’s increasing resentment harry’s best subject had suddenly become potions thanks to the half-blood prince. nonverbal spells were now expected not only in defense against the dark arts but in charms and transfiguration too. harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on u-no-poo but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. it was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in herbology but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the venomous tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind. one result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that harry ron and hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit hagrid. he had stopped coming to meals at the staff table an ominous sign and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings. “we’ve got to go and explain,” said hermione looking up at hagrid ’s huge empty chair at the staff table the following saturday at breakfast. “we’ve got quidditch tryouts this morning!” said ron. “and we’re supposed to be practicing that aguamenti charm from flitwick! anyway explain what how are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?” “we didn’t hate it!” said hermione. “speak for yourself i haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” said ron darkly. “and i’m telling you now we’ve had a narrow escape. you didn’t hear him going on about his gormless brother — we’d have been teaching grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.” “i hate not talking to hagrid,” said hermione looking upset. “well go down after quidditch,” harry assured her. he too was missing hagrid although like ron he thought that they were better off without grawp in their lives. “but trials might take all morning the number of people who have applied.” he felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his captaincy. “i dunno why the team’s this popular all of a sudden.” “oh come on harry,” said hermione suddenly impatient. “it’s not quidditch that’s popular it’s you! you’ve never been more interesting and frankly you’ve never been more fanciable.” ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to harry. “everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now don’t they the whole wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. and now they’re calling you ‘the chosen one’ — well come on can’t you see why people are fascinated by you?” harry was finding the great hall very hot all of a sudden even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy. “and you’ve been through all that persecution from the ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. you can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood but you stuck to your story anyway. ...” “you can still see where those brains got hold of me in the ministry look,” said ron shaking back his sleeves. “and it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the summer either,” hermione finished ignoring ron. “i’m tall,” said ron inconsequentially. the post owls arrived swooping down through rain flecked windows scattering everyone with droplets of water. most people were receiving more post than usual anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them in turn that all was well at home. harry had received no mail since the start of term his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that lupin might write occasionally he had so far been disappointed. he was very surprised therefore to see the snowy white hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. she landed in front of him carrying a large square package. a moment later an identical package landed in front of ron crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl pigwidgeon. “ha!” said harry unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of advanced potion-making fresh from flourish and blotts. “oh good,” said hermione delighted. “now you can give that graffitied copy back.” “are you mad?” said harry. “i’m keeping it! look i’ve thought it out — ” he pulled the old copy of advanced potion-making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand muttering “diffindol” the cover fell off. he did the same thing with the brand-new book hermione looked scandalized). he then swapped the covers tapped each and said “reparo\” there sat the prince’s copy disguised as a new book and there sat the fresh copy from flourish and blotts looking thoroughly secondhand. “i’ll give slughorn back the new one he can’t complain it cost nine galleons.” hermione pressed her lips together looking angry and disapproving but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day’s copy of the daily prophet. she unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page. “anyone we know dead?” asked ron in a determinedly casual voice he posed the same question every time hermione opened her paper. “no but there have been more dementor attacks,” said hermione. “and an arrest.” “excellent who?” said harry thinking of bellatrix lestrange. “stan shunpike,” said hermione. “what?” said harry startled. “ ‘stanley shunpike  conductor on the popular wizarding conveyance the knight bus has been arrested on suspicion of death eater activity. mr. shunpike 21 was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his clapham home ...’ ” “stan shunpike a death eater?” said harry remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. “no way!” “he might have been put under the imperius curse,” said ron reasonably. “you never can tell.” “it doesn’t look like it,” said hermione who was still reading. “it says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the death eaters’ secret plans in a pub.” she looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “if he was under the imperius curse he’d hardly stand around gossiping about their plans would he?” “it sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,” said ron. “isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become minister of magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?” “yeah that’s him,” said harry. “i dunno what they’re playing at taking stan seriously.” “they probably want to look as though they’re doing something,” said hermione frowning. “people are terrified — you know the patil twins’ parents want them to go home and eloise midgen has already been withdrawn. her father picked her up last night.” “what!” said ron goggling at hermione. “but hogwarts is safer than their homes bound to be! we’ve got aurors and all those extra protective spells and we’ve got dumbledore!” “i don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said hermione very quietly glancing toward the staff table over the top of the prophet “haven’t you noticed his seat’s been empty as often as hagrid’s this past week.” harry and ron looked up at the staff table. the headmaster’s chair was indeed empty. now harry came to think of it he had not seen dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago. “i think he’s left the school to do something with the order,” said hermione in a low voice. “i mean ... it’s all looking serious isn’t it harry and ron did not answer but harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. there had been a horrible incident the day before when hannah abbott had been taken out of herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. they had not seen hannah since. when they left the gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the quidditch pitch they passed lavender brown and parvati patil. remembering what hermione had said about the patil twins’ parents wanting them to leave hogwarts harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together looking distressed. what did surprise him was that when ron drew level with them parvati suddenly nudged lavender who looked around and gave ron a wide smile. ron blinked at her then returned the smile uncertainly. his walk instantly became something more like a strut. harry resisted the temptation to laugh remembering that ron had refrained from doing so after malfoy had broken harry’s nose hermione however looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool misty drizzle and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing ron good luck. as harry had expected the trials took most of the morning. half of gryffindor house seemed to have turned up from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms to seventh years who towered over the rest looking coolly intimidating. the latter included a large wiry-haired boy harry recognized immediately from the hogwarts express. “we met on the train in old sluggy’s compartment,” he said confidently stepping out of the crowd to shake harry’s hand. “cormac mclaggen keeper.” “you didn’t try out last year did you?” asked harry taking note of the breadth of mclaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving. “i was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” said mclaggen with something of a swagger. “ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.” “right,” said harry. “well ... if you wait over there ...” he pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where hermione was sitting. he thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over mclaggen’s face and wondered whether mclaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both “old sluggy’s” favorites. harry decided to start with a basic test asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. this was a good decision the first ten was made up of first years and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts. the second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls harry had ever encountered who when he blew his whistle merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. romilda vane was amongst them. when he told them to leave the pitch they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else. the third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. the fifth group were hufflepuffs. “if there’s anyone else here who’s not from gryffindor,” roared harry who was starting to get seriously annoyed “leave now please!” there was a pause then a couple of little ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch snorting with laughter. after two hours many complaints and several tantrums one involving a crashed comet two sixty and several broken teeth harry had found himself three chasers katie bell returned to the team after an excellent trial a new find called demelza robins who was particularly good at dodging bludgers and ginny weasley who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. pleased though he was with his choices harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected beaters. “that’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of the way for the keepers i’ll hex you,” he bellowed. neither of his chosen beaters had the old brilliance of fred and george but he was still reasonably pleased with them jimmy peakes a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of harry’s head with a ferociously hit bludger and ritchie coote who looked weedy but aimed well. they now joined katie demelza and ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member. harry had deliberately left the trial of the keepers until last hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. unfortunately however all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now so that it was larger than ever. as each keeper flew up to the goal hoops the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. harry glanced over at ron who had always had a problem with nerves harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it but apparently not ron was a delicate shade of green. none of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. to harry’s great disappointment cormac mclaggen saved four penalties out of five. on the last one however he shot off in completely the wrong direction the crowd laughed and booed and mclaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth. ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his cleansweep eleven. “good luck!” cried a voice from the stands. harry looked around expecting to see hermione but it was lavender brown. he would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands as she did a moment later but thought that as the captain he ought to show slightly more grit and so turned to watch ron do his trial. yet he need not have worried ron saved one two three four five penalties in a row. delighted and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty harry turned to mclaggen to tell him that most unfortunately ron had beaten him only to find mclaggen’s red face inches from his own. he stepped back hastily. “his sister didn’t really try,” said mclaggen menacingly. there was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one harry had often admired in uncle vernon’s. “she gave him an easy save.” “rubbish,” said harry coldly. “that was the one he nearly missed.” mclaggen took a step nearer harry who stood his ground this time. “give me another go.” “no,” said harry. “you’ve had your go. you saved four. ron saved five. ron’s keeper he won it fair and square. get out of my way.” he thought for a moment that mclaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away growling what sounded like threats to thin air. harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him. “well done,” he croaked. “you flew really well — ” “you did brilliantly ron!” this time it really was hermione running toward them from the stands harry saw lavender walking off the pitch arm in arm with parvati a rather grumpy expression on her face. ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at hermione. after fixing the time of their first full practice for the following thursday harry ron and hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward hagrid’s. a watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. harry felt extremely hungry he hoped there would be something to eat at hagrid’s. “i thought i was going to miss that fourth penalty,” ron was saying happily. “tricky shot from demelza did you see had a bit of spin on it — ” “yes yes you were magnificent,” said hermione looking amused. “i was better than that mclaggen anyway,” said ron in a highly satisfied voice. “did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth looked like he’d been confunded. ...” to harry’s surprise hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. ron noticed nothing he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail. the great gray hippogriff buckbeak was tethered in front of hagrid’s cabin. he clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them. “oh dear,” said hermione nervously. “he’s still a bit scary isn’t he?” “come off it you’ve ridden him haven’t you?” said ron. harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. after a few seconds buckbeak sank into a bow too. “how are you?” harry asked him in a low voice moving forward to stroke the feathery head. “missing him but you’re okay here with hagrid aren’t you?” “oi!” said a loud voice. hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. his enormous boarhound fang was at his heels fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward. “git away from him! hell have yer fingers — oh. it’s yeh lot.” fang was jumping up at hermione and ron attempting to lick their ears. hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second then turned and strode into his cabin slamming the door behind him. “oh dear!” said hermione looking stricken. “don’t worry about it,” said harry grimly. he walked over to the door and knocked loudly. “hagrid! open up we want to talk to you!” there was no sound from within. “if you don’t open the door we’ll blast it open!” harry said pulling out his wand. “harry!” said hermione sounding shocked. “you can’t possibly — ” “yeah i can!” said harry. “stand back — ” but before he could say anything else the door flew open again as harry had known it would and there stood hagrid glowering down at him and looking despite the flowery apron positively alarming. “i’m a teacher!” he roared at harry. “a teacher potter! how dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!” ‘tm sorry sir,” said harry emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes. hagrid looked stunned. “since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?” “since when have you called me ‘potter’?” “oh very clever,” growled hagrid. “very amusin’. that’s me outsmarted innit all righ’ come in then yeh ungrateful little ...” mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pass. hermione scurried in after harry looking rather frightened. “well?” said hagrid grumpily as harry ron and hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table fang laying his head immediately upon harry’s knee and drooling all over his robes. “what’s this feelin’ sorry for me reckon i’m lonely or summat?” “no,” said harry at once. “we wanted to see you.” “we’ve missed you!” said hermione tremulously. “missed me have yeh?” snorted hagrid. “yeah. righ’.” he stomped around brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle muttering all the while. finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. harry was hungry enough even for hagrid’s cooking and took one at once. “hagrid,” said hermione timidly when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong “we really wanted to carry on with care of magical creatures you know.” hagrid gave another great snort. harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner. “we did!” said hermione. “but none of us could fit it into our schedules!” “yeah. righ’,” said hagrid again. there was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around hermione let out a tiny shriek and ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. it was full of what looked like foot-long maggots slimy white and writhing. “what are they hagrid?” asked harry trying to sound interested rather than revolted but putting down his rock cake all the same. “jus’ giant grubs,” said hagrid. “and they grow into ... ” said ron looking apprehensive. “they won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said hagrid. “i got ’em ter feed ter aragog.” and without warning he burst into tears. “hagrid!” cried hermione leaping up hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. “what is it?” “it’s ... him ...” gulped hagrid his beetle-black eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. “it’s ... aragog. ... i think he’s dyin’. ... he got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. ... i don’ know what i’ll do if he ... if he ... we’ve bin tergether so long. ...” hermione patted hagrid’s shoulder looking at a complete loss for anything to say. harry knew how she felt. he had known hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies the gigantic talking spider aragog who dwelled deep in the forbidden forest and which he and ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously. “is there — is there anything we can do?” hermione asked ignoring ron’s frantic grimaces and head shakings. “i don’ think there is hermione,” choked hagrid attempting to stem the flood of his tears. “see the rest o’ the tribe ... aragog’s family ... they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill ... bit restive ...” “yeah i think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said ron in an undertone. ... i don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo’,” hagrid finished blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. “but thanks fer offerin’ hermione. ... it means a lot. ...” after that the atmosphere lightened considerably for although neither harry nor ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous gargantuan spider hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more. “ar i always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,” he said gruffly pouring them more tea. “even if yeh applied fer time-turners — ” “we couldn’t have done,” said hermione. “we smashed the entire stock of ministry time-turners when we were there last summer. it was in the daily prophet.” “ar well then,” said hagrid. “there’s no way yeh could’ve done it. ... i’m sorry i’ve bin — yeh know — i’ve jus’ bin worried abou’ aragog ... an’ i did wonder whether if professor grubbly-plank had bin teachin’ yeh at which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that professor grubbly-plank who had substituted for hagrid a few times was a dreadful teacher with the result that by the time hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk he looked quite cheerful. “i’m starving,” said harry once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. “and i’ve got that detention with snape tonight i haven’t got much time for dinner. ...” as they came into the castle they spotted cormac mclaggen entering the great hall. it took him two attempts to get through the doors he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the hall after him but harry caught hermione ’s arm and held her back. “what?” said hermione defensively. “if you ask me,” said harry quietly “mclaggen looks like he was confunded this morning. and he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.” hermione blushed. “oh all right then i did it,” she whispered. “but you should have heard the way he was talking about ron and ginny! anyway he’s got a nasty temper you saw how he reacted when he didn’t get in — you wouldn’t have wanted someone like that on the team.” “no,” said harry. “no i suppose that’s true. but wasn’t that dishonest hermione i mean you’re a prefect aren’t you?” “oh be quiet,” she snapped as he smirked. “what are you two doing?” demanded ron reappearing in the doorway to the great hall and looking suspicious. “nothing,” said harry and hermione together and they hurried after ron. the smell of roast beef made harry’s stomach ache with hunger but they had barely taken three steps toward the gryffindor table when professor slughorn appeared in front of them blocking their path. “harry harry just the man i was hoping to see!” he boomed genially twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly. “i was hoping to catch you before dinner! what do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead we’re having a little party just a few rising stars i’ve got mclaggen coming and zabini the charming melinda bobbin — i don’t know whether you know her her family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and of course i hope very much that miss granger will favor me by coming too.” slughorn made hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. it was as though ron was not present slughorn did not so much as look at him. “i can’t come professor,” said harry at once. “i’ve got a detention with professor snape.” “oh dear!” said slughorn his face falling comically. “dear dear i was counting on you harry! well now i’ll just have to have a word with severus and explain the situation. i’m sure i’ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. yes i’ll see you both later!” he bustled away out of the hall. “he’s got no chance of persuading snape,” said harry the moment slughorn was out of earshot. “this detention’s already been postponed once snape did it for dumbledore but he won’t do it for anyone else.” “oh i wish you could come i don’t want to go on my own!” said hermione anxiously harry knew that she was thinking about mclaggen. “i doubt you’ll be alone ginny’ll probably be invited,” snapped ron who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by slughorn. after dinner they made their way back to gryffindor tower. the common room was very crowded as most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down ron who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with slughorn folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. hermione reached out for a copy of the evening prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair. “anything new?” said harry. “not really ...” hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. “oh look your dad’s in here ron — he’s all right!” she added quickly for ron had looked around in alarm. “it just says he’s been to visit the malfoys’ house. ‘this second search of the death eater’s residence does not seem to have yielded any results. arthur weasley of the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off’” “yeah mine!” said harry. “i told him at king’s cross about malfoy and that thing he was trying to get borgin to fix! well if it’s not at their house he must have brought whatever it is to hogwarts with him — ” “but how can he have done harry?” said hermione putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. “we were all searched when we arrived weren’t we?” “were you?” said harry taken aback. “i wasn’t!” “oh no of course you weren’t i forgot you were late. ... well filch ran over all of us with secrecy sensors when we got into the entrance hall. any dark object would have been found i know for a fact crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. so you see malfoy can’t have brought in anything dangerous!” momentarily stymied harry watched ginny weasley playing with arnold the pygmy puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection. “someone’s sent it to him by owl then,” he said. “his mother or someone.” “all the owls are being checked too,” said hermione. “filch told us so when he was jabbing those secrecy sensors everywhere he could reach.” really stumped this time harry found nothing else to say. there did not seem to be any way malfoy could have brought a dangerous or dark object into the school. he looked hopefully at ron who was sitting with his arms folded staring over at lavender brown. “can you think of any way malfoy — ” “oh drop it harry,” said ron. “listen it’s not my fault slughorn invited hermione and me to his stupid party neither of us wanted to go you know!” said harry firing up. “well as i’m not invited to any parties,” said ron getting to his feet again “i think i’ll go to bed.” he stomped off toward the door to the boys’ dormitories leaving harry and hermione staring after him. “harry?” said the new chaser demelza robins appearing suddenly at his shoulder. “i’ve got a message for you.” “from professor slughorn?” asked harry sitting up hopefully. “no ... from professor snape,” said demelza. harry’s heart sank. “he says you’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no matter how many party invitations you’ve received. and he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones to use in potions and — and he says there’s no need to bring protective gloves.” “right,” said harry grimly. “thanks a lot demelza.” silver and opals where was dumbledore and what was he doing harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. he rarely appeared at meals anymore and harry was sure hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. had dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving harry dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy harry had felt bolstered comforted and now he felt slightly abandoned. halfway through october came their first trip of the term to hogsmeade. harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed given the increasingly tight security measures around the school but was pleased to know that they were going ahead it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours. harry woke early on the morning of the trip which was proving stormy and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of advanced potion making. he did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks that sort of behavior as ron rightly said was indecent in anybody except hermione who was simply weird that way. harry felt however that the half-blood prince’s copy of advanced potion-making hardly qualified as a textbook. the more harry pored over the book the more he realized how much was in there not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with slughorn but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins which harry was sure judging by the crossings-out and revisions that the prince had invented himself. harry had already attempted a few of the prince’s self invented spells. there had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast he had tried this on crabbe in the corridor with very entertaining results a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth which he had twice used to general applause on an unsuspecting argus filch and perhaps most useful of all muffliato a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. the only person who did not find these charms amusing was hermione who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if harry had used the muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity. sitting up in bed harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the prince some trouble. there were many crossings-out and alterations but finally crammed into a corner of the page the scribble levicorpus nvbl while the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows and neville snored loudly harry stared at the letters in brackets. nvbl ... that had to mean “nonverbal.” harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells something snape had been quick to comment on in every d.a.d.a. class. on the other hand the prince had proved a much more effective teacher than snape so far. pointing his wand at nothing in particular he gave it an upward flick and said levicorpusl inside his head. “ aaaaaaaargh ! ” there was a flash of light and the room was full of voices everyone had woken up as ron had let out a yell. harry sent advanced potion-making flying in panic ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle. “sorry!” yelled harry as dean and seamus roared with laughter and neville picked himself up from the floor having fallen out of bed. “hang on — i’ll let you down — ” he groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic trying to find the right page at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell praying that this was the counter-jinx harry thought liberacorpus with all his might. there was another flash of light and ron fell in a heap onto his mattress. “sorry,” repeated harry weakly while dean and seamus continued to roar with laughter. “tomorrow,” said ron in a muffled voice “i’d rather you set the alarm clock.” by the time they had got dressed padding themselves out with several of mrs. weasley’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks scarves and gloves ron’s shock had subsided and he had decided that harry’s new spell was highly amusing so amusing in fact that he lost no time in regaling hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast. ... and then there was another flash of light and i landed on the bed again!” ron grinned helping himself to sausages. hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon harry. “was this spell by any chance another one from that potion book of yours?” she asked. harry frowned at her. “always jump to the worst conclusion don’t you?” “was it?” “well ... yeah it was but so what?” “so you just decided to try out an unknown handwritten incantation and see what would happen?” “why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said harry preferring not to answer the rest of the question. “because it’s probably not ministry of magic approved,” said hermione. “and also,” she added as harry and ron rolled their eyes “because i’m starting to think this prince character was a bit dodgy.” both harry and ron shouted her down at once. “it was a laugh!” said ron upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. “just a laugh hermione that’s all!” “dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said hermione. “who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?” “fred and george,” said ron shrugging “it’s their kind of thing. and er — ” “my dad,” said harry. he had only just remembered. “what?” said ron and hermione together. “my dad used this spell,” said harry. “i — lupin told me.” this last part was not true in fact harry had seen his father use the spell on snape but he had never told ron and hermione about that particular excursion into the pensieve. now however a wonderful possibility occurred to him. could the half blood prince possibly be —  “maybe your dad did use it harry,” said hermione “but he’s not the only one. we’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it in case you’ve forgotten. dangling people in the air. making them float along asleep helpless.” harry stared at her. with a sinking feeling he too remembered the behavior of the death eaters at the quidditch world cup. ron came to his aid. “that was different,” he said robustly. “they were abusing it. harry and his dad were just having a laugh. you don’t like the prince hermione,” he added pointing a sausage at her sternly “because he’s better than you at potions — ” “it’s got nothing to do with that!” said hermione her cheeks reddening. “i just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t even know what they’re for and stop talking about ‘the prince’ as if it’s his title i bet it’s just a stupid nickname and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!” “i don’t see where you get that from,” said harry heatedly. “if he’d been a budding death eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?” even as he said it harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood but he pushed the thought out of his mind he would worry about that later. ... “the death eaters can’t all be pure-blood there aren’t enough pure-blood wizards left,” said hermione stubbornly. “i expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. it’s only muggle-borns they hate they’d be quite happy to let you and ron join up.” “there is no way they’d let me be a death eater!” said ron indignantly a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at hermione and hitting ernie macmillan on the head. “my whole family are blood traitors! that’s as bad as muggle-borns to death eaters!” “and they’d love to have me,” said harry sarcastically. “we’d be best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me in. this made ron laugh even hermione gave a grudging smile and a distraction arrived in the shape of ginny. “hey harry i’m supposed to give you this.” it was a scroll of parchment with harry’s name written upon it in familiar thin slanting writing. “thanks ginny ... it’s dumbledore’s next lesson!” harry told ron and hermione pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. “monday evening!” he felt suddenly light and happy. “want to join us in hogsmeade ginny?” he asked. “i’m going with dean — might see you there,” she replied waving at them as she left. filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual checking off the names of people who had permission to go into hogsmeade. the process took even longer than normal as filch was triple-checking everybody with his secrecy sensor. “what does it matter if we’re smuggling dark stuff out?” demanded ron eyeing the long thin secrecy sensor with apprehension. “surely you ought to be checking what we bring back in?” his cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the sensor and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet. the walk into hogsmeade was not enjoyable. harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. the road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. more than once harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room and when they finally reached hogsmeade and saw that zonko’s joke shop had been boarded up harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. ron pointed with a thickly gloved hand toward honeydukes which was mercifully open and harry and hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop. “thank god,” shivered ron as they were enveloped by warm toffee-scented air. “let’s stay here all afternoon.” “harry m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind them. “oh no,” muttered harry. the three of them turned to see professor slughorn who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop. “harry that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!” said slughorn poking him genially in the chest. “it won’t do m’boy i’m determined to have you! miss granger loves them don’t you?” “yes,” said hermione helplessly “they’re really — ” “so why don’t you come along harry?” demanded slughorn. “well i’ve had quidditch practice professor,” said harry who had indeed been scheduling practices every time slughorn had sent him a little violet ribbon-adorned invitation. this strategy meant that ron was not left out and they usually had a laugh with ginny imagining hermione shut up with mclaggen and zabini. “well i certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work!” said slughorn. “but a little recreation never hurt anybody. now how about monday night you can’t possibly want to practice in this weather. ...” “i can’t professor i’ve got — er — an appointment with professor dumbledore that evening.” “unlucky again!” cried slughorn dramatically. “ah well ... you can’t evade me forever harry!” and with a regal wave he waddled out of the shop taking as little notice of ron as though he had been a display of cockroach clusters. “i can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said hermione shaking her head. “they’re not that bad you know. ... they’re even quite fun sometimes. ...” but then she caught sight of ron’s expression. “oh look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours!” glad that hermione had changed the subject harry showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done but ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when hermione asked him where he wanted to go next. “let’s go to the three broomsticks,” said harry. “it’ll be warm.” they bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. the bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of honeydukes. the street was not very busy nobody was lingering to chat just hurrying toward their destinations. the exceptions were two men a little ahead of them standing just outside the three broomsticks. one was very tall and thin squinting through his rain-washed glasses harry recognized the barman who worked in the other hogsmeade pub the hog’s head. as harry ron and hermione drew closer the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. they were barely feet from him when harry realized who the man was. “mundungus!” the squat bandy-legged man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase which burst open releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window. “oh ’ello ’arry,” said mundungus fletcher with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. “well don’t let me keep ya.” and he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone. “are you selling this stuff?” asked harry watching mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground. “oh well gotta scrape a living,” said mundungus. “gimme that!” ron had stooped down and picked up something silver. “hang on,” ron said slowly. “this looks familiar — ” “thank you!” said mundungus snatching the goblet out of ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case. “well i’ll see you all — ouch!” harry had pinned mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. holding him fast with one hand he pulled out his wand. “harry!” squealed hermione. “you took that from sirius’s house,” said harry who was almost nose to nose with mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. “that had the black family crest on it.” “i — no — what — ” spluttered mundungus who was slowly turning purple. “what did you do go back the night he died and strip the place?” snarled harry. “i — no — ” “give it to me!” “harry you mustn’t!” shrieked hermione as mundungus started to turn blue. there was a bang and harry felt his hands fly off mundungus’s throat. gasping and spluttering mundungus seized his fallen case then — crack — he disapparated. harry swore at the top of his voice spinning on the spot to see where mundungus had gone. “come back you thieving — !” “there’s no point harry.” tonks had appeared out of nowhere her mousy hair wet with sleet. “mundungus will probably be in london by now. there’s no point yelling.” “he’s nicked sirius’s stuff! nicked it!” “yes but still,” said tonks who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. “you should get out of the cold.” she watched them go through the door of the three broomsticks. the moment he was inside harry burst out “he was nicking sirius’s stuff.” “i know harry but please don’t shout people are staring,” whispered hermione. “go and sit down i’ll get you a drink.” harry was still fuming when hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer. “can’t the order control mundungus?” harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. “can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?” “shh!” said hermione desperately looking around to make sure nobody was listening there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at harry with great interest and zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. “harry i’d be annoyed too i know it’s your things he’s stealing — ” harry gagged on his butterbeer he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve grimmauld place. “yeah it’s my stuff!” he said. “no wonder he wasn’t pleased to see me! well i’m going to tell dumbledore what’s going on he’s the only one who scares mundungus.” “good idea,” whispered hermione clearly pleased that harry was calming down. “ron what are you staring at?” “nothing,” said ron hastily looking away from the bar but harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid madam rosmerta for whom he had long nursed a soft spot. “i expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more firewhisky,” said hermione waspishly. ron ignored this jibe sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. harry was thinking about sirius and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. hermione drummed her fingers on the table her eyes flickering between ron and the bar. the moment harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said “shall we call it a day and go back to school then?” the other two nodded it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them rearranged their scarves pulled on their gloves then followed katie bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the high street. harry’s thoughts strayed to ginny as they trudged up the road to hogwarts through the frozen slush. they had not met up with her undoubtedly thought harry because she and dean were cozily closeted in madam puddifoot’s tea shop that haunt of happy couples. scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on. it was a little while before harry became aware that the voices of katie bell and her friend which were being carried back to him on the wind had become shriller and louder. harry squinted at their indistinct figures. the two girls were having an argument about something katie was holding in her hand. “it’s nothing to do with you leanne!” harry heard katie say. they rounded a corner in the lane sleet coming thick and fast blurring harry’s glasses. just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them leanne made to grab hold of the package katie was holding katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground. at once katie rose into the air not as ron had done suspended comically by the ankle but gracefully her arms outstretched as though she was about to fly. yet there was something wrong something eerie. ... her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. harry ron hermione and leanne had all halted in their tracks watching. then six feet above the ground katie let out a terrible scream. her eyes flew open but whatever she could see or whatever she was feeling was clearly causing her terrible anguish. she screamed and screamed leanne started to scream too and seized katie’s ankles trying to tug her back to the ground. harry ron and hermione rushed forward to help but even as they grabbed katie’s legs she fell on top of them harry and ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed apparently unable to recognize any of them. harry looked around the landscape seemed deserted. “stay there!” he shouted at the others over the howling wind. “i’m going for help!” he began to sprint toward the school he had never seen anyone behave as katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs. “hagrid!” he panted disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen. “harry!” said hagrid who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard and was wearing his great shaggy beaverskin coat. “jus’ bin visitin’ grawp he’s cornin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — ” “hagrid someone’s hurt back there or cursed or something — ” “wha?” said hagrid bending lower to hear what harry was saying over the raging wind. “someone’s been cursed!” bellowed harry. “cursed who’s bin cursed — not ron hermione?” “no it’s not them it’s katie bell — this way ...” together they ran back along the lane. it took them no time to find the little group of people around katie who was still writhing and screaming on the ground ron hermione and leanne were all trying to quiet her. “get back!” shouted hagrid. “lemme see her!” “something’s happened to her!” sobbed leanne. “i don’t know what — ” hagrid stared at katie for a second then without a word bent down scooped her into his arms and ran off toward the castle with her. within seconds katie’s piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind. hermione hurried over to katie’s wailing friend and put an arm around her. “it’s leanne isn’t it?” the girl nodded. “did it just happen all of a sudden or — ” “it was when that package tore,” sobbed leanne pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on the ground which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. ron bent down his hand outstretched but harry seized his arm and pulled him back. “don’t touch if!” he crouched down. an ornate opal necklace was visible poking out of the paper. “i’ve seen that before,” said harry staring at the thing. “it was on display in borgin and burkes ages ago. the label said it was cursed. katie must have touched it.” he looked up at leanne who had started to shake uncontrollably. “how did katie get hold of this?” “well that’s why we were arguing. she came back from the bathroom in the three broomsticks holding it said it was a surprise for somebody at hogwarts and she had to deliver it. she looked all funny when she said it. ... oh no oh no i bet she’d been imperiused and i didn’t realize!” leanne shook with renewed sobs. hermione patted her shoulder gently. “she didn’t say who’d given it to her leanne?” “no ... she wouldn’t tell me ... and i said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school but she just wouldn’t listen and ... and then i tried to grab it from her . . . and — and — ” leanne let out a wail of despair. “we’d better get up to school,” said hermione her arm still around leanne. “we’ll be able to find out how she is. come on. ...” harry hesitated for a moment then pulled his scarf from around his face and ignoring ron’s gasp carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up. “well need to show this to madam pomfrey,” he said. as they followed hermione and leanne up the road harry was thinking furiously. they had just entered the grounds when he spoke unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer. “malfoy knows about this necklace. it was in a case at borgin and burkes four years ago i saw him having a good look at it while i was hiding from him and his dad. this is what he was buying that day when we followed him! he remembered it and he went back for it!” “i — i dunno harry,” said ron hesitantly. “loads of people go to borgin and burkes ... and didn’t that girl say katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?” “she said she came back from the bathroom with it she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ” “mcgonagall!” said ron warningly. harry looked up. sure enough professor mcgonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them. “hagrid says you four saw what happened to katie bell — upstairs to my office at once please! what’s that you’re holding potter?” “it’s the thing she touched,” said harry. “good lord,” said professor mcgonagall looking alarmed as she took the necklace from harry. “no no filch they’re with me!” she added hastily as filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his secrecy sensor aloft. “take this necklace to professor snape at once but be sure not to touch it keep it wrapped in the scarf!” harry and the others followed professor mcgonagall upstairs and into her office. the sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. professor mcgonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face harry ron hermione and the still sobbing leanne. “well?” she said sharply. “what happened?” haltingly and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying leanne told professor mcgonagall how katie had gone to the bathroom in the three broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package how katie had seemed a little odd and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel which tore open. at this point leanne was so overcome there was no getting another word out of her. “all right,” said professor mcgonagall not unkindly “go up to the hospital wing please leanne and get madam pomfrey to give you something for shock.” when she had left the room professor mcgonagall turned back to harry ron and hermione. “what happened when katie touched the necklace?” “she rose up in the air,” said harry before either ron or hermione could speak “and then began to scream and collapsed. professor can i see professor dumbledore please?” “the headmaster is away until monday potter,” said professor mcgonagall looking surprised. “away?” harry repeated angrily. “yes potter away!” said professor mcgonagall tartly. “but anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me i’m sure!” for a split second harry hesitated. professor mcgonagall did not invite confidences dumbledore though in many ways more intimidating still seemed less likely to scorn a theory however wild. this was a life-and-death matter though and no moment to worry about being laughed at. “i think draco malfoy gave katie that necklace professor.” on one side of him ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment on the other hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and harry. “that is a very serious accusation potter,” said professor mcgonagall after a shocked pause. “do you have any proof?” “no,” said harry “but ...” and he told her about following malfoy to borgin and burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and mr. borgin. when he had finished speaking professor mcgonagall looked slightly confused. “malfoy took something to borgin and burkes for repair?” “no professor he just wanted borgin to tell him how to mend something he didn’t have it with him. but that’s not the point the thing is that he bought something at the same time and i think it was that necklace — ” “you saw malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?” “no professor he told borgin to keep it in the shop for him — ” “but harry,” hermione interrupted “borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him and malfoy said no — “because he didn’t want to touch it obviously!” said harry angrily. “what he actually said was ‘how would i look carrying that down the street?’ ” said hermione. “well he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,” interjected ron. “oh ron,” said hermione despairingly “it would be all wrapped up so he wouldn’t have to touch it and quite easy to hide inside a cloak so nobody would see it! i think whatever he reserved at borgin and burkes was noisy or bulky something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and in any case,” she pressed on loudly before harry could interrupt “i asked borgin about the necklace don’t you remember when i went in to try and find out what malfoy had asked him to keep i saw it there. and borgin just told me the price he didn’t say it was already sold or anything — ” “well you were being really obvious he realized what you were up to within about five seconds of course he wasn’t going to tell you — anyway malfoy could’ve sent off for it since — ” “that’s enough!” said professor mcgonagall as hermione opened her mouth to retort looking furious. “potter i appreciate you telling me this but we cannot point the finger of blame at mr. malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. the same is probably true of hundreds of people — ” “ — that’s what i said — ” muttered ron. “ — and in any case we have put stringent security measures in place this year. i do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge — ” “but — ” “ — and what is more,” said professor mcgonagall with an air of awful finality “mr. malfoy was not in hogsmeade today.” harry gaped at her deflating. “how do you know professor?” “because he was doing detention with me. he has now failed to complete his transfiguration homework twice in a row. so thank you for telling me your suspicions potter,” she said as she marched past them “but i need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on katie bell. good day to you all.” she held open her office door. they had no choice but to file past her without another word. harry was angry with the other two for siding with mcgonagall nevertheless he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened. “so who do you reckon katie was supposed to give the necklace to?” asked ron as they climbed the stairs to the common room. “goodness only knows,” said hermione. “but whoever it was has had a narrow escape. no one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.” “it could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said harry. “dumbledore — the death eaters would love to get rid of him he must be one of their top targets. or slughorn — dumbledore reckons voldemort really wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided with dumbledore. or — ” “or you,” said hermione looking troubled. “couldn’t have been,” said harry “or katie would’ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me wouldn’t she i was behind her all the way out of the three broomsticks. it would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside hogwarts what with filch searching everyone who goes in and out. i wonder why malfoy told her to take it into the castle?” “harry malfoy wasn’t in hogsmeade!” said hermione actually stamping her foot in frustration. “he must have used an accomplice then,” said harry. “crabbe or goyle — or come to think of it another death eater he’ll have loads better cronies than crabbe and goyle now he’s joined up — ” ron and hermione exchanged looks that plainly said there’s no point arguing with him. “dilligrout,” said hermione firmly as they reached the fat lady. the portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. it was quite full and smelled of damp clothing many people seemed to have returned from hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. there was no buzz of fear or speculation however clearly the news of katie’s fate had not yet spread. “it wasn’t a very slick attack really when you stop and think about it,” said ron casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. “the curse didn’t even make it into the castle. not what you’d call foolproof.” “you’re right,” said hermione prodding ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. “it wasn’t very well thought-out at all.” “but since when has malfoy been one of the world’s great thinkers?” asked harry. neither ron nor hermione answered him. the secret riddle katie was removed to st. mungo’s hospital for magical maladies and injuries the following day by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school though the details were confused and nobody other than harry ron hermione and leanne seemed to know that katie herself had not been the intended target. “oh and malfoy knows of course,” said harry to ron and hermione who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever harry mentioned his malfoy-is-a-death-eater theory. harry had wondered whether dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for monday night’s lesson but having had no word to the contrary he presented himself outside dumbledore ’s office at eight o’clock knocked and was told to enter. there sat dumbledore looking unusually tired his hand was as black and burned as ever but he smiled when he gestured to harry to sit down. the pensieve was sitting on the desk again casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling. “you have had a busy time while i have been away,” dumbledore said. “i believe you witnessed katie’s accident.” “yes sir. how is she?” “still very unwell although she was relatively lucky. she appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin there was a tiny hole in her glove. had she put it on had she even held it in her ungloved hand she would have died perhaps instantly. luckily professor snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse — “why him?” asked harry quickly. “why not madam pomfrey?” “impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall and phineas nigellus black sirius’s great-great-grandfather raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. “i would not have permitted a student to question the way hogwarts operated in my day.” “yes thank you phineas,” said dumbledore quellingly. “professor snape knows much more about the dark arts than madam pomfrey harry. anyway the st. mungo’s staff are sending me hourly reports and i am hopeful that katie will make a full recovery in time.” “where were you this weekend sir?” harry asked disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck a feeling apparently shared by phineas nigellus who hissed softly. “i would rather not say just now,” said dumbledore. “however i shall tell you in due course.” “you will?” said harry startled. “yes i expect so,” said dumbledore withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand. “sir,” said harry tentatively “i met mundungus in hogsmeade.” “ah yes i am already aware that mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,” said dumbledore frowning a little. “he has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the three broomsticks i rather think he dreads facing me. however rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of sirius’s old possessions.” “that mangy old half-blood has been stealing black heirlooms?” said phineas nigellus incensed and he stalked out of his frame undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve grimmauld place. “professor,” said harry after a short pause “did professor mcgonagall tell you what i told her after katie got hurt about draco malfoy?” “she told me of your suspicions yes,” said dumbledore. “and do you — ” “i shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in katie’s accident,” said dumbledore. “but what concerns me now harry is our lesson.” harry felt slightly resentful at this if their lessons were so very important why had there been such a long gap between the first and second however he said no more about draco malfoy but watched as dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his long-fingered hands. “you will remember i am sure that we left the tale of lord voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the handsome muggle tom riddle had abandoned his witch wife merope and returned to his family home in little hangleton. merope was left alone in london expecting the baby who would one day become lord voldemort.” “how do you know she was in london sir?” “because of the evidence of one caractacus burke,” said dumbledore “who by an odd coincidence helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.” he swilled the contents of the pensieve as harry had seen him swill them before much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. up out of the swirling silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the pensieve silver as a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes. “yes we acquired it in curious circumstances. it was brought in by a young witch just before christmas oh many years ago now. she said she needed the gold badly well that much was obvious. covered in rags and pretty far along ... going to have a baby see. she said the locket had been slytherin’s. well we hear that sort of story all the time ‘oh this was merlin’s this was his favorite teapot,’ but when i looked at it it had his mark all right and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. of course that made it near enough priceless. she didn’t seem to have any idea how much it was worth. happy to get ten galleons for it. best bargain we ever made!” dumbledore gave the pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and caractacus burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come. “he only gave her ten galleons?” said harry indignantly. “caractacus burke was not famed for his generosity,” said dumbledore. “so we know that near the end of her pregnancy merope was alone in london and in desperate need of gold desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession the locket that was one of marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.” “but she could do magic!” said harry impatiently. “she could have got food and everything for herself by magic couldn’t she?” “ah,” said dumbledore “perhaps she could. but it is my belief — i am guessing again but i am sure i am right — that when her husband abandoned her merope stopped using magic. i do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. of course it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers that can happen. in any case as you are about to see merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.” “she wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?” dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “could you possibly be feeling sorry for lord voldemort?” “no,” said harry quickly “but she had a choice didn’t she not like my mother — ” “your mother had a choice too,” said dumbledore gently. “yes merope riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly harry. she was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother’s courage. and now if you will stand ...” “where are we going?” harry asked as dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk. “this time,” said dumbledore “we are going to enter my memory. i think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. after you harry ...” harry bent over the pensieve his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. ... seconds later his feet hit firm ground he opened his eyes and found that he and dumbledore were standing in a bustling old fashioned london street. “there i am,” said dumbledore brightly pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart. this younger albus dumbledore ’s long hair and beard were auburn. having reached their side of the street he strode off along the pavement drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing. “nice suit sir,” said harry before he could stop himself but dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim square building surrounded by high railings. he mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. after a moment or two the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron. “good afternoon. i have an appointment with a mrs. cole who i believe is the matron here?” “oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl taking in dumbledore ’s eccentric appearance. “um ... just a mo’ ... mrs. cole!” she bellowed over her shoulder. harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. the girl turned back to dumbledore. “come in she’s on ’er way.” dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. harry and the older dumbledore followed. before the front door had closed behind them a skinny harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. she had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward dumbledore. ... and take the iodine upstairs to martha billy stubbs has been picking his scabs and eric whalley’s oozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of everything else,” she said to nobody in particular and then her eyes fell upon dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold. “good afternoon,” said dumbledore holding out his hand. mrs. cole simply gaped. “my name is albus dumbledore. i sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.” mrs. cole blinked. apparently deciding that dumbledore was not a hallucination she said feebly “oh yes. well — well then — you’d better come into my room. yes.” she led dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room part office. it was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. she invited dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk eyeing him nervously. “i am here as i told you in my letter to discuss tom riddle and arrangements for his future,” said dumbledore. “are you family?” asked mrs. cole. “no i am a teacher,” said dumbledore. “i have come to offer tom a place at my school.” “what school’s this then?” “it is called hogwarts,” said dumbledore. “and how come you’re interested in tom?” “we believe he has qualities we are looking for.” “you mean he’s won a scholarship how can he have done he’s never been entered for one.” “well his name has been down for our school since birth — ” “who registered him his parents?” there was no doubt that mrs. cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. apparently dumbledore thought so too for harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from mrs. cole’s desktop. “here,” said dumbledore waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper “i think this will make everything clear.” mrs. cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment. “that seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly handing it back. then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before. “er — may i offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an extra-refined voice. “thank you very much,” said dumbledore beaming. it soon became clear that mrs. cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. pouring both of them a generous measure she drained her own glass in one gulp. smacking her lips frankly she smiled at dumbledore for the first time and he didn’t hesitate to press his advantage. “i was wondering whether you could tell me anything of tom riddle’s history i think he was born here in the orphanage?” “that’s right,” said mrs. cole helping herself to more gin. “i remember it clear as anything because i’d just started here myself. new year’s eve and bitter cold snowing you know. nasty night. and this girl not much older than i was myself at the time came staggering up the front steps. well she wasn’t the first. we took her in and she had the baby within the hour. and she was dead in another hour.” mrs. cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin. “did she say anything before she died?” asked dumbledore. “anything about the boy’s father for instance?” “now as it happens she did,” said mrs. cole who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story. “i remember she said to me ‘i hope he looks like his papa,’ and i won’t lie she was right to hope it because she was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named tom for his father and marvolo for her father — yes i know funny name isn’t it we wondered whether she came from a circus — and she said the boy’s surname was to be riddle. and she died soon after that without another word. “well we named him just as she’d said it seemed so important to the poor girl but no tom nor marvolo nor any kind of riddle ever came looking for him nor any family at all so he stayed in the orphanage and he’s been here ever since.” mrs. cole helped herself almost absentmindedly to another healthy measure of gin. two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. then she said “he’s a funny boy.” “yes,” said dumbledore. “i thought he might be.” “he was a funny baby too. he hardly ever cried you know. and then when he got a little older he was . . . odd.” “odd in what way?” asked dumbledore gently. “well he — ” but mrs. cole pulled up short and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot dumbledore over her gin glass. “he’s definitely got a place at your school you say?” “definitely,” said dumbledore. “and nothing i say can change that?” “nothing,” said dumbledore. “you’ll be taking him away whatever?” “whatever,” repeated dumbledore gravely. she squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. apparently she decided she could because she said in a sudden rush “he scares the other children.” “you mean he is a bully?” asked dumbledore. “i think he must be,” said mrs. cole frowning slightly “but it’s very hard to catch him at it. there have been incidents. ... nasty things ...” dumbledore did not press her though harry could tell that he was interested. she took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still. “billy stubbs’s rabbit ... well tom said he didn’t do it and i don’t see how he could have done but even so it didn’t hang itself from the rafters did it?” “i shouldn’t think so no,” said dumbledore quietly. “but i’m jiggered if i know how he got up there to do it. all i know is he and billy had argued the day before. and then” — mrs. cole took another swig of gin slopping a little over her chin this time — “on the summer outing — we take them out you know once a year to the countryside or to the seaside — well amy benson and dennis bishop were never quite right afterwards and all we ever got out of them was that they’d gone into a cave with tom riddle. he swore they’d just gone exploring but something happened in there i’m sure of it. and well there have been a lot of things funny things. ...” she looked around at dumbledore again and though her cheeks were flushed her gaze was steady. “i don’t think many people will be sorry to see the back of him.” “you understand i’m sure that we will not be keeping him permanently?” said dumbledore. “he will have to return here at the very least every summer.” “oh well that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,” said mrs. cole with a slight hiccup. she got to her feet and harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady even though two-thirds of the gin was now gone. “i suppose you’d like to see him?” “very much,” said dumbledore rising too. she led him out of her office and up the stone stairs calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed. the orphans harry saw were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. they looked reasonably well-cared for but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up. “here we are,” said mrs. cole as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. she knocked twice and entered. “tom you’ve got a visitor. this is mr. dumberton — sorry dunderbore. he’s come to tell you — well i’ll let him do it.” harry and the two dumbledores entered the room and mrs. cole closed the door on them. it was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe a wooden chair and an iron bedstead. a boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets his legs stretched out in front of him holding a book. there was no trace of the gaunts in tom riddle’s face. merope had got her dying wish he was his handsome father in miniature tall for eleven years old dark-haired and pale. his eyes narrowed slightly as he took in dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. there was a moment’s silence. “how do you do tom?” said dumbledore walking forward and holding out his hand. the boy hesitated then took it and they shook hands. dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside riddle so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor. “i am professor dumbledore.” “ ‘professor?” repeated riddle. he looked wary. “is that like ‘doctor what are you here for did she get you in to have a look at me?” he was pointing at the door through which mrs. cole had just left. “no no,” said dumbledore smiling. “i don’t believe you,” said riddle. “she wants me looked at doesn’t she tell the truth!” he spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. it was a command and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. his eyes had widened and he was glaring at dumbledore who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. after a few seconds riddle stopped glaring though he looked if anything warier still. “who are you?” “i have told you. my name is professor dumbledore and i work at a school called hogwarts. i have come to offer you a place at my school — your new school if you would like to come.” riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. he leapt from the bed and backed away from dumbledore looking furious. “you can’t kid me! the asylum that’s where you’re from isn’t it ‘professor,’ yes of course — well i’m not going see that old cat’s the one who should be in the asylum. i never did anything to little amy benson or dennis bishop and you can ask them they’ll tell you!” “i am not from the asylum,” said dumbledore patiently. “i am a teacher and if you will sit down calmly i shall tell you about hogwarts. of course if you would rather not come to the school nobody will force you — ” “i’d like to see them try,” sneered riddle. “hogwarts,” dumbledore went on as though he had not heard riddle’s last words “is a school for people with special abilities — ” “i’m not mad!” “i know that you are not mad. hogwarts is not a school for mad people. it is a school of magic.” there was silence. riddle had frozen his face expressionless but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of dumbledore’s as though trying to catch one of them lying. “magic?” he repeated in a whisper. “that’s right,” said dumbledore. “it’s ... it’s magic what i can do?” “what is it that you can do?” “all sorts,” breathed riddle. a flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks he looked fevered. “i can make things move without touching them. i can make animals do what i want them to do without training them. i can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. i can make them hurt if i want to.” his legs were trembling. he stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hands his head bowed as though in prayer. “i knew i was different,” he whispered to his own quivering fingers. “i knew i was special. always i knew there was something.” “well you were quite right,” said dumbledore who was no longer smiling but watching riddle intently. “you are a wizard.” riddle lifted his head. his face was transfigured there was a wild happiness upon it yet for some reason it did not make him better looking on the contrary his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher his expression almost bestial. “are you a wizard too?” “yes i am.” “prove it,” said riddle at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said “tell the truth.” dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “if as i take it you are accepting your place at hogwarts — ” “of course i am!” “then you will address me as ‘professor’ or ‘sir.’ ” riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said in an unrecognizably polite voice “i’m sorry sir. i meant — please professor could you show me — ” harry was sure that dumbledore was going to refuse that he would tell riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at hogwarts that they were currently in a building full of muggles and must therefore be cautious. to his great surprise however dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick. the wardrobe burst into flames. riddle jumped to his feet harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possessions must be in there. but even as riddle rounded on dumbledore the flames vanished leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged. riddle stared from the wardrobe to dumbledore then his expression greedy he pointed at the wand. “where can i get one of them?” “all in good time,” said dumbledore. “i think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.” and sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. for the first time riddle looked frightened. “open the door,” said dumbledore. riddle hesitated then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. on the topmost shelf above a rail of threadbare clothes a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it. “take it out,” said dumbledore. riddle took down the quaking box. he looked unnerved. “is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked dumbledore. riddle threw dumbledore a long clear calculating look. “yes i suppose so sir,” he said finally in an expressionless voice. “open it,” said dumbledore. riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them. harry who had expected something much more exciting saw a mess of small everyday objects a yo-yo a silver thimble and a tarnished mouth organ among them. once free of the box they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets. “you will return them to their owners with your apologies,” said dumbledore calmly putting his wand back into his jacket. “i shall know whether it has been done. and be warned thieving is not tolerated at hogwarts.” riddle did not look remotely abashed he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at dumbledore. at last he said in a colorless voice “yes sir.” “at hogwarts,” dumbledore went on “we teach you not only to use magic but to control it. you have — inadvertently i am sure — been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. you are not the first nor will you be the last to allow your magic to run away with you. but you should know that hogwarts can expel students and the ministry of magic — yes there is a ministry — will punish lawbreakers still more severely. all new wizards must accept that in entering our world they abide by our laws.” “yes sir,” said riddle again. it was impossible to tell what he was thinking his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. when he had finished he turned to dumbledore and said baldly “i haven’t got any money.” “that is easily remedied,” said dumbledore drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. “there is a fund at hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. you might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand but — ” “where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted riddle who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking dumbledore and was now examining a fat gold galleon. “in diagon alley,” said dumbledore. “i have your list of books and school equipment with me. i can help you find everything — ” “you’re coming with me?” asked riddle looking up. “certainly if you — ” “i don’t need you,” said riddle. “i’m used to doing things for myself i go round london on my own all the time. how do you get to this diagon alley — sir?” he added catching dumbledore ’s eye. harry thought that dumbledore would insist upon accompanying riddle but once again he was surprised. dumbledore handed riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment and after telling riddle exactly how to get to the leaky cauldron from the orphanage he said “you will be able to see it although muggles around you — non-magical people that is — will not. ask for tom the barman — easy enough to remember as he shares your name — ” riddle gave an irritable twitch as though trying to displace an irksome fly. “you dislike the name tom’?” “there are a lot of toms,” muttered riddle. then as though he could not suppress the question as though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked “was my father a wizard he was called tom riddle too they’ve told me.” “i’m afraid i don’t know,” said dumbledore his voice gentle. “my mother can’t have been magic or she wouldn’t have died,” said riddle more to himself than dumbledore. “it must’ve been him. so — when i’ve got all my stuff — when do i come to this hogwarts?” “all the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,” said dumbledore. “you will leave from king’s cross station on the first of september. there is a train ticket in there too.” riddle nodded. dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. taking it riddle said “i can speak to snakes. i found out when we’ve been to the country on trips — they find me they whisper to me. is that normal for a wizard?” harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress. “it is unusual,” said dumbledore after a moment’s hesitation “but not unheard of.” his tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over riddle’s face. they stood for a moment man and boy staring at each other. then the handshake was broken dumbledore was at the door. “good-bye tom. i shall see you at hogwarts.” “i think that will do,” said the white-haired dumbledore at harry’s side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the present-day office. “sit down,” said dumbledore landing beside harry. harry obeyed his mind still full of what he had just seen. “he believed it much quicker than i did — i mean when you told him he was a wizard,” said harry. “i didn’t believe hagrid at first when he told me.” “yes riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use his word — ‘special,’ ” said dumbledore. “did you know — then?” asked harry. “did i know that i had just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time?” said dumbledore. “no i had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. however i was certainly intrigued by him. i returned to hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something i should have done in any case given that he was alone and friendless but which already i felt i ought to do for others’ sake as much as his. “his powers as you heard were surprisingly well developed for such a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of all — he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them and begun to use them consciously. and as you saw they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards he was already using magic against other people to frighten to punish to control. the little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. ... ‘i can make them hurt if i want to. ...”’ “and he was a parselmouth,” interjected harry. “yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the dark arts although as we know there are parselmouths among the great and the good too. in fact his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty secrecy and domination. “time is making fools of us again,” said dumbledore indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. “but before we part i want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings. “firstly i hope you noticed riddle’s reaction when i mentioned that another shared his first name tom’?” harry nodded. “there he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people anything that made him ordinary. even then he wished to be different separate notorious. he shed his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘lord voldemort’ behind which he has been hidden for so long. “i trust that you also noticed that tom riddle was already highly self-sufficient secretive and apparently friendless he did not want help or companionship on his trip to diagon alley. he preferred to operate alone. the adult voldemort is the same. you will hear many of his death eaters claiming that they are in his confidence that they alone are close to him even understand him. they are deluded. lord voldemort has never had a friend nor do i believe that he has ever wanted one. “and lastly — i hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this harry — the young tom riddle liked to collect trophies. you saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. these were taken from victims of his bullying behavior souvenirs if you will of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. bear in mind this magpie-like tendency for this particularly will be important later. “and now it really is time for bed.” harry got to his feet. as he walked across the room his eyes fell upon the little table on which marvolo gaunt’s ring had rested last time but the ring was no longer there. “yes harry?” said dumbledore for harry had come to a halt. “the ring’s gone,” said harry looking around. “but i thought you might have the mouth organ or something.” dumbledore beamed at him peering over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “very astute harry but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.” and on that enigmatic note he waved to harry who understood himself to be dismissed. felix felicis harry had herbology first thing the following morning. he had been unable to tell ron and hermione about his lesson with dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. the weekend’s brutal wind had died out at last the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse. “wow scary thought the boy you-know-who,” said ron quietly as they took their places around one of the gnarled snargaluff stumps that formed this term’s project and began pulling on their protective gloves. “but i still don’t get why dumbledore’s showing you all this. i mean it’s really interesting and everything but what’s the point?” “dunno,” said harry inserting a gum shield. “but he says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.” “i think it’s fascinating,” said hermione earnestly. “it makes absolute sense to know as much about voldemort as possible. how else will you find out his weaknesses?” “so how was slughorn’s latest party?” harry asked her thickly through the gum shield. “oh it was quite fun really,” said hermione now putting on protective goggles. “i mean he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit and he absolutely fawns on mclaggen because he’s so well-connected but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to gwenog jones.” “gwenog jones?” said ron his eyes widening under his own goggles. “the gwenog jones captain of the holyhead harpies?” “that’s right,” said hermione. “personally i thought she was a bit full of herself but — ” “quite enough chat over here!” said professor sprout briskly bustling over and looking stern. “you’re lagging behind everybody else has started and neville’s already got his first pod!” they looked around sure enough there sat neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. “okay professor we’re starting now!” said ron adding quietly when she had turned away again “should’ve used muffliato harry.” “no we shouldn’t!” said hermione at once looking as she always did intensely cross at the thought of the half-blood prince and his spells. “well come on ... we’d better get going. ...” she gave the other two an apprehensive look they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them. it sprang to life at once long prickly bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. one tangled itself in hermione’s hair and ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole which closed like a trap around her elbow harry and ron tugged and wrenched at the vines forcing the hole to open again and hermione snatched her arm free clutching in her fingers a pod just like neville’s. at once the prickly vines shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood. “you know i don’t think i’ll be having any of these in my garden when i’ve got my own place,” said ron pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face. “pass me a bowl,” said hermione holding the pulsating pod at arm’s length harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face. “don’t be squeamish squeeze it out they’re best when they’re fresh!” called professor sprout. “anyway,” said hermione continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them “slughorn’s going to have a christmas party harry and there’s no way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.” harry groaned. meanwhile ron who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it standing up and squashing it as hard as he could said angrily “and this is another party just for slughorn’s favorites is it?” “just for the slug club yes,” said hermione. the pod flew out from under ron’s fingers and hit the greenhouse glass rebounding onto the back of professor sprout’s head and knocking off her old patched hat. harry went to retrieve the pod when he got back hermione was saying “look didn’t make up the name ‘slug club’ — ” “ ‘slug club,’ ” repeated ron with a sneer worthy of malfoy. “it’s pathetic. well i hope you enjoy your party. why don’t you try hooking up with mclaggen then slughorn can make you king and queen slug — “we’re allowed to bring guests,” said hermione who for some reason had turned a bright boiling scarlet “and i was going to ask you to come but if you think it’s that stupid then i won’t bother!” harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. unnoticed by either he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of unfortunately he could still hear every word of their conversation. “you were going to ask me?” asked ron in a completely different voice. “yes,” said hermione angrily. “but obviously if you’d rather i hooked up with mclaggen ...” there was a pause while harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel. “no i wouldn’t,” said ron in a very quiet voice. harry missed the pod hit the bowl and shattered it. “reparo,” he said hastily poking the pieces with his wand and the bowl sprang back together again. the crash however appeared to have awoken ron and hermione to harry’s presence. hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of flesh-eating trees of the world to find out the correct way to juice snargaluff pods ron on the other hand looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself. “hand that over harry,” said hermione hurriedly. “it says we’re supposed to puncture them with something sharp. ...” harry passed her the pod in the bowl he and ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived once more for the stump. it was not as though he was really surprised thought harry as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. but he was not sure how he felt about it. ... he and cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other let alone talk to each other what if ron and hermione started going out together then split up could their friendship survive it harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. and then what if they didn’t split up what if they became like bill and fleur and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence so that he was shut out for good “gotcha!” yelled ron pulling a second pod from the stump just as hermione managed to burst the first one open so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms. the rest of the lesson passed without further mention of slughorn’s party. although harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days ron and hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party. in the meantime however he had more pressing worries. katie bell was still in st. mungo’s hospital with no prospect of leaving which meant that the promising gryffindor team harry had been training so carefully since september was one chaser short. he kept putting off replacing katie in the hope that she would return but their opening match against slytherin was looming and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play. harry did not think he could stand another full house tryout. with a sinking feeling that had little to do with quidditch he cornered dean thomas after transfiguration one day. most of the class had already left although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room all of hermione ’s creation nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air. “are you still interested in playing chaser?” “wha —  yeah of course!” said dean excitedly. over dean’s shoulder harry saw seamus finnigan slamming his books into his bag looking sour. one of the reasons why harry would have preferred not to have to ask dean to play was that he knew seamus would not like it. on the other hand he had to do what was best for the team and dean had outflown seamus at the tryouts. “well then you’re in,” said harry. “there’s a practice tonight seven o’clock.” “right,” said dean. “cheers harry! blimey i can’t wait to tell ginny!” he sprinted out of the room leaving harry and seamus alone together an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on seamus’s head as one of hermione’s canaries whizzed over them. seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of katie’s substitute. there was much muttering in the common room about the fact that harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. as harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career he was not particularly bothered but all the same the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against slytherin. if gryffindor won harry knew that the whole house would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. if they lost ... well harry thought wryly he had still endured worse mutterings. ... harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw dean fly that evening he worked well with ginny and demelza. the beaters peakes and coote were getting better all the time. the only problem was ron. harry had known all along that ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence and unfortunately the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. after letting in half a dozen goals most of them scored by ginny his technique became wilder and wilder until he finally punched an oncoming demelza robins in the mouth. “it was an accident i’m sorry demelza really sorry!” ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground dripping blood everywhere. “i just — ” “panicked,” ginny said angrily landing next to demelza and examining her fat lip. “you prat ron look at the state of her!” “i can fix that,” said harry landing beside the two girls pointing his wand at demelza’s mouth and saying “episkey.” “and ginny don’t call ron a prat you’re not the captain of this team — ” “well you seemed too busy to call him a prat and i thought someone should — ” harry forced himself not to laugh. “in the air everyone let’s go. ...” overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term though harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match. “good work everyone i think we’ll flatten slytherin,” he said bracingly and the chasers and beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves. “i played like a sack of dragon dung,” said ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind ginny. “no you didn’t,” said harry firmly. “you’re the best keeper i tried out ron. your only problem is nerves.” he kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle and by the time they reached the second floor ron was looking marginally more cheerful. when harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to gryffindor tower however they found themselves looking at dean and ginny who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together. it was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in harry’s stomach clawing at his insides hot blood seemed to flood his brain so that all thought was extinguished replaced by a savage urge to jinx dean into a jelly. wrestling with this sudden madness he heard ron’s voice as though from a great distance away. “oi!” dean and ginny broke apart and looked around. “what?” said ginny. “i don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!” “this was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!” said ginny. dean was looking embarrassed. he gave harry a shifty grin that harry did not return as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for dean’s instant dismissal from the team. “er ... c’mon ginny,” said dean “let’s go back to the common room. ...” “you go!” said ginny. “i want a word with my dear brother!” dean left looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene. “right,” said ginny tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at ron “let’s get this straight once and for all. it is none of your business who i go out with or what i do with them ron — ” “yeah it is!” said ron just as angrily. “d’you think i want people saying my sister’s a — ” “a what?” shouted ginny drawing her wand. “a what exactly?” “he doesn’t mean anything ginny — ” said harry automatically though the monster was roaring its approval of ron’s words. “oh yes he does!” she said flaring up at harry. “just because he’s never snogged anyone in his life just because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our auntie muriel — ” “shut your mouth!” bellowed ron bypassing red and turning maroon. “no i will not!” yelled ginny beside herself. “i’ve seen you with phlegm hoping shell kiss you on the cheek every time you see her it’s pathetic! if you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!” ron had pulled out his wand too harry stepped swiftly between them. “you don’t know what you’re talking about!” ron roared trying to get a clear shot at ginny around harry who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. “just because i don’t do it in public — !” ginny screamed with derisive laughter trying to push harry out of the way. “been kissing pigwidgeon have you or have you got a picture of auntie muriel stashed under your pillow?” “you—” a streak of orange light flew under harry’s left arm and missed ginny by inches harry pushed ron up against the wall. “don’t be stupid — ” “harry’s snogged cho chang!” shouted ginny who sounded close to tears now. “and hermione snogged viktor krum it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting ron and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!” and with that she stormed away. harry quickly let go of ron the look on his face was murderous. they both stood there breathing heavily until mrs. norris filch ’s cat appeared around the corner which broke the tension. “c’mon,” said harry as the sound of filch ’s shuffling feet reached their ears. they hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. “oi out of the way!” ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn. harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass he felt disoriented dizzy being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. it’s just because she’s ron’s sister he told himself. you just didn’t like seeing her kissing dean because she’s ron’s sister. ... but unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing ginny instead. ... the monster in his chest purred ... but then he saw ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on harry shouting things like “betrayal of trust” . . . “supposed to be my friend” . . . “d’you think hermione did snog krum?” ron asked abruptly as they approached the fat lady. harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no ron intruded in which he and ginny were quite alone — “what?” he said confusedly. “oh ... er ...” the honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to give it. however ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on harry’s face. “dilligrout,” he said darkly to the fat lady and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room. neither of them mentioned ginny or hermione again indeed they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence each absorbed in his own thoughts. harry lay awake for a long time looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for ginny were entirely elder brotherly. they had lived had they not like brother and sister all summer playing quidditch teasing ron and having a laugh about bill and phlegm he had known ginny for years now. ... it was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip dean limb from limb for kissing her ... no ... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . . ron gave a great grunting snore. she’s ron’s sister harry told himself firmly. ron’s sister. she’s out-of-bounds. he would not risk his friendship with ron for anything. he punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near ginny. harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which ron had chased him with a beater’s bat but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream ron for the real one who was not only cold-shouldering ginny and dean but also treating a hurt and bewildered hermione with an icy sneering indifference. what was more ron seemed to have become overnight as touchy and ready to lash out as the average blast ended skrewt. harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between ron and hermione with no success finally hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon and ron stalked off to the boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him. to harry’s dismay ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. worse still it coincided with an even deeper dip in his keeping skills which made him still more aggressive so that during the final quidditch practice before saturday’s match he failed to save every single goal the chasers aimed at him but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced demelza robins to tears. “you shut up and leave her alone!” shouted peakes who was about two-thirds ron’s height though admittedly carrying a heavy bat. “enough!” bellowed harry who had seen ginny glowering in ron’s direction and remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the bat bogey hex soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. “peakes go and pack up the bludgers. demelza pull yourself together you played really well today. ron ...” he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it “you’re my best mate but carry on treating the rest of them like this and i’m going to kick you off the team.” he really thought for a moment that ron might hit him but then something much worse happened ron seemed to sag on his broom all the fight went out of him and he said “i resign. i’m pathetic.” “you’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said harry fiercely seizing ron by the front of his robes. “you can save anything when you’re on form it’s a mental problem you’ve got!” “you calling me mental?” “yeah maybe i am!” they glared at each other for a moment then ron shook his head wearily. “i know you haven’t got any time to find another keeper so i’ll play tomorrow but if we lose and we will i’m taking myself off the team.” nothing harry said made any difference. he tried boosting ron’s confidence all through dinner but ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with hermione to notice. harry persisted in the common room that evening but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner clearly muttering about ron and casting him nasty looks. finally harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking ron into a defiant and hopefully goal-saving attitude but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever. harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. he did not want to lose the upcoming match not only was it his first as captain but he was determined to beat draco malfoy at quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. yet if ron played as he had done in the last few practices their chances of winning were very slim. ... if only there was something he could do to make ron pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . something that would ensure that ron had a really good day. ... and the answer came to harry in one sudden glorious stroke of inspiration. breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning the slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the gryffindor team entered the great hall. harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear pale blue sky a good omen. the gryffindor table a solid mass of red and gold cheered as harry and ron approached. harry grinned and waved ron grimaced weakly and shook his head. “cheer up ron!” called lavender. “i know you’ll be brilliant!” ron ignored her. “tea?” harry asked him. “coffee pumpkin juice?” “anything,” said ron glumly taking a moody bite of toast. a few minutes later hermione who had become so tired of ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table. “how are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively her eyes on the back of ron’s head. “fine,” said harry who was concentrating on handing ron a glass of pumpkin juice. “there you go ron. drink up.” ron had just raised the glass to his lips when hermione spoke sharply. “don’t drink that ron!” both harry and ron looked up at her. “why not?” said ron. hermione was now staring at harry as though she could not believe her eyes. “you just put something in that drink.” “excuse me?” said harry. “you heard me. i saw you. you just tipped something into ron’s drink. you’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!” “i don’t know what you’re talking about,” said harry stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket. “ron i warn you don’t drink it!” hermione said again alarmed but ron picked up the glass drained it in one gulp and said “stop bossing me around hermione.” she looked scandalized. bending low so that only harry could hear her she hissed “you should be expelled for that. i’d never have believed it of you harry!” “hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “confunded anyone lately?” she stormed up the table away from them. harry watched her go without regret. hermione had never really understood what a serious business quidditch was. he then looked around at ron who was smacking his lips. “nearly time,” said harry blithely. the frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium. “pretty lucky the weather’s this good eh?” harry asked ron. “yeah,” said ron who was pale and sick-looking. ginny and demelza were already wearing their quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room. “conditions look ideal,” said ginny ignoring ron. “and guess what that slytherin chaser vaisey — he took a bludger in the head yesterday during their practice and he’s too sore to play! and even better than that — malfoy’s gone off sick too!” “ what?” said harry wheeling around to stare at her. “he’s ill what’s wrong with him?” “no idea but it’s great for us,” said ginny brightly. “they’re playing harper instead he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.” harry smiled back vaguely but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from quidditch. malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the slytherins better. why was he now happy to let a substitute go on was he really ill or was he faking “fishy isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to ron. “malfoy not playing?” “lucky i call it,” said ron looking slightly more animated. “and vaisey off too he’s their best goal scorer i didn’t fancy — hey!” he said suddenly freezing halfway through pulling on his keeper’s gloves and staring at harry. “what?” “i ... you ...” ron had dropped his voice he looked both scared and excited. “my drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you didn’t ... ” harry raised his eyebrows but said nothing except “well be starting in about five minutes you’d better get your boots on.” they walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. one end of the stadium was solid red and gold the other a sea of green and silver. many hufflepuffs and ravenclaws had taken sides too amidst all the yelling and clapping harry could distinctly hear the roar of luna lovegood’s famous lion-topped hat. harry stepped up to madam hooch the referee who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate. “captains shake hands,” she said and harry had his hand crushed by the new slytherin captain urquhart. “mount your brooms. on the whistle ... three ... two ... one ...” the whistle sounded harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground and they were away. harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds looking around for the snitch and keeping one eye on harper who was zigzagging far below him. then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentator’s started up. “well there they go and i think we’re all surprised to see the team that potter’s put together this year. many thought given ronald weasley’s patchy performance as keeper last year that he might be off the team but of course a close personal friendship with the captain does help. ...” these words were greeted with jeers and applause from the slytherin end of the pitch. harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator’s podium. a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there talking into the magical megaphone that had once been lee jordan’s harry recognized zacharias smith a hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked. “oh and here comes slytherin ’s first attempt on goal it’s urquhart streaking down the pitch and — ” harry’s stomach turned over. “ — weasley saves it well he’s bound to get lucky sometimes i suppose. ...” “that’s right smith he is,” muttered harry grinning to himself as he dived amongst the chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive snitch. with half an hour of the game gone gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero ron having made some truly spectacular saves some by the very tips of his gloves and ginny having scored four of gryffindor’s six goals. this effectively stopped zacharias wondering loudly whether the two weasleys were only there because harry liked them and he started on peakes and coote instead. “of course coote isn’t really the usual build for a beater,” said zacharias loftily “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle — ” “hit a bludger at him!” harry called to coote as he zoomed past but coote grinning broadly chose to aim the next bludger at harper instead who was just passing harry in the opposite direction. harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the bludger had found its mark. it seemed as though gryffindor could do no wrong. again and again they scored and again and again at the other end of the pitch ron saved goals with apparent ease. he was actually smiling now and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite “weasley is our king,” he pretended to conduct them from on high. “thinks he’s something special today doesn’t he?” said a snide voice and harry was nearly knocked off his broom as harper collided with him hard and deliberately. “your blood-traitor pal ...” madam hooch’s back was turned and though gryffindors below shouted in anger by the time she looked around harper had already sped off. his shoulder aching harry raced after him determined to ram him back. . . . “and i think harper of slytherin’s seen the snitch!” said zacharias smith through his megaphone. “yes he’s certainly seen something potter hasn’t!” smith really was an idiot thought harry hadn’t he noticed them collide but next moment his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky — smith was right and harry was wrong harper had not sped upward at random he had spotted what harry had not the snitch was speeding along high above them glinting brightly against the clear blue sky. harry accelerated the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of smith’s commentary or the crowd but harper was still ahead of him and gryffindor was only a hundred points up if harper got there first gryffindor had lost . . . and now harper was feet from it his hand outstretched. ... “oi harper!” yelled harry in desperation. “how much did malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?” he did not know what made him say it but harper did a double-take he fumbled the snitch let it slip through his fingers and shot right past it. harry made a great swipe for the tiny fluttering ball and caught it. “yes!” harry yelled. wheeling around he hurtled back toward the ground the snitch held high in his hand. as the crowd realized what had happened a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game. “ginny where ’re you going?” yelled harry who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team but ginny sped right on past them until with an almighty crash she collided with the commentator’s podium. as the crowd shrieked and laughed the gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which zacharias was feebly stirring harry heard ginny saying blithely to an irate professor mcgonagall “forgot to brake professor sorry.” laughing harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged ginny but let go very quickly. avoiding her gaze he clapped a cheering ron on the back instead as all enmity forgotten the gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm punching the air and waving to their supporters. the atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. “party up in the common room seamus said!” yelled dean exuberantly. “c’mon ginny demelza!” ron and harry were the last two in the changing room. they were just about to leave when hermione entered. she was twisting her gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. “i want a word with you harry.” she took a deep breath. “you shouldn’t have done it. you heard slughorn it’s illegal.” “what are you going to do turn us in?” demanded ron. “what are you two talking about?” asked harry turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning. “you know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said hermione shrilly. “you spiked ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! felix felicis!” “no i didn’t,” said harry turning back to face them both. “yes you did harry and that’s why everything went right there were slytherin players missing and ron saved everything!” “i didn’t put it in!” said harry grinning broadly. he slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that hermione had seen in his hand that morning. it was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “i wanted ron to think i’d done it so i faked it when i knew you were looking.” he looked at ron. “you saved everything because you felt lucky. you did it all yourself.” he pocketed the potion again. “there really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” ron said astounded. “but the weather’s good ... and vaisey couldn’t play. ... i honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?” harry shook his head. ron gaped at him for a moment then rounded on hermione imitating her voice. “ you added felix felicis to ron’s juice this morning that’s why he saved every thing see! i can save goals without help hermione!” “i never said you couldn’t — ron you thought you’d been given it too!” but ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder. “er,” said harry into the sudden silence he had not expected his plan to backfire like this “shall ... shall we go up to the party then?” “you go!” said hermione blinking back tears. “i’m sick of ron at the moment i don’t know what i’m supposed to have done. ...” and she stormed out of the changing room too. harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd many of whom shouted congratulations at him but he felt a great sense of letdown he had been sure that if ron won the match he and hermione would be friends again immediately. he did not see how he could possibly explain to hermione that what she had done to offend ron was kiss viktor krum not when the offense had occurred so long ago. harry could not see hermione at the gryffindor celebration party which was in full swing when he arrived. renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. what with trying to shake off the creevey brothers who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis and the large group of girls that encircled him laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids it was some time before he could try and find ron. at last he extricated himself from romilda vane who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to slughorn’s christmas party with him. as he was ducking toward the drinks table he walked straight into ginny arnold the pygmy puff riding on her shoulder and crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels. “looking for ron?” she asked smirking. “he’s over there the filthy hypocrite.” harry looked into the corner she was indicating. there in full view of the whole room stood ron wrapped so closely around lavender brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. “it looks like he’s eating her face doesn’t it?” said ginny dispassionately. “but i suppose he’s got to refine his technique somehow. good game harry.” she patted him on the arm harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. crookshanks trotted after her his yellow eyes fixed upon arnold. harry turned away from ron who did not look like he would be surfacing soon just as the portrait hole was closing. with a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight. he darted forward sidestepped romilda vane again and pushed open the portrait of the fat lady. the corridor outside seemed to be deserted. “hermione?” he found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. she was sitting on the teacher’s desk alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. harry could not help admiring her spell-work at a time like this. “oh hello harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “i was just practicing.” “yeah ... they’re — er — really good. ...” said harry. he had no idea what to say to her. he was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed ron that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy when she said in an unnaturally high-pitched voice “ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.” “er . . . does he?” said harry. “don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said hermione. “he wasn’t exactly hiding it was — ” the door behind them burst open. to harry’s horror ron came in laughing pulling lavender by the hand. “oh,” he said drawing up short at the sight of harry and hermione. “oops!” said lavender and she backed out of the room giggling. the door swung shut behind her. there was a horrible swelling billowing silence. hermione was staring at ron who refused to look at her but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness “hi harry! wondered where you’d got to!” hermione slid off the desk. the little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange feathery model of the solar system. “you shouldn’t leave lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly. “she’ll wonder where you’ve gone.” she walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. harry glanced at ron who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened. “ oppugno\” came a shriek from the doorway. harry spun around to see hermione pointing her wand at ron her expression wild the little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward ron who yelped and covered his face with his hands but the birds attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach. “gerremoffme!” he yelled but with one last look of vindictive fury hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed. the unbreakable vow snow was swirling against the icy windows once more christmas was approaching fast. hagrid had already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve christmas trees for the great hall garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time harry went past which caused blockages in the corridors fortunately however harry’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways so that he was able without too much difficulty to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes. ron who might once have found the necessity of these detours a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity simply roared with laughter about it all. although harry much preferred this new laughing joking ron to the moody aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks the improved ron came at a heavy price. firstly harry had to put up with the frequent presence of lavender brown who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing ron as a moment wasted and secondly harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again. ron whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from hermione’s bird attack was taking a defensive and resentful tone. “she can’t complain,” he told harry. “she snogged krum. so she’s found out someone wants to snog me too. well it’s a free country. i haven’t done anything wrong.” harry did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before charms next morning quintessence a quest). determined as he was to remain friends with both ron and hermione he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight. “i never promised hermione anything,” ron mumbled. “i mean all right i was going to go to slughorn’s christmas party with her but she never said ... just as friends ... i’m a free agent. ...” harry turned a page of quintessence aware that ron was watching him. ron’s voice tailed away in mutters barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire though harry thought he caught the words “krum” and “can’t complain” again. hermione’s schedule was so full that harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings when ron was in any case so tightly wrapped around lavender that he did not notice what harry was doing. hermione refused to sit in the common room while ron was there so harry generally joined her in the library which meant that their conversations were held in whispers. “he’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” said hermione while the librarian madam pince prowled the shelves behind them. “i really couldn’t care less.” she raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. harry said nothing. he thought his voice might soon vanish from lack of use. he bent a little lower over advanced potion-making and continued to make notes on everlasting elixirs occasionally pausing to decipher the prince’s useful additions to libatius borage’s text. “and incidentally,” said hermione after a few moments “you need to be careful.” “for the last time,” said harry speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence “i am not giving back this book i’ve learned more from the half-blood prince than snape or slughorn have taught me in — ” “i’m not talking about your stupid so-called prince,” said hermione giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “i’m talking about earlier. i went into the girls’ bathroom just before i came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there including that romilda vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. they’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take them to slughorn ’s party and they all seem to have bought fred and george’s love potions which i’m afraid to say probably work — ” “why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded harry. it seemed extraordinary that hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture. “they didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said hermione scornfully. “they were just discussing tactics. as i doubt whether even the half blood prince ” — she gave the book another nasty look — “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once i’d just invite someone to go with you thatll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance. it’s tomorrow night they’re getting desperate.” “there isn’t anyone i want to invite,” mumbled harry who was still trying not to think about ginny any more than he could help despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that ron could not perform legilimency. “well just be careful what you drink because romilda vane looked like she meant business,” said hermione grimly. she hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. harry watched her with his mind a long way away. “hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “i thought filch had banned anything bought at weasleys’ wizard wheezes?” “and when has anyone ever paid attention to what filch has banned?” asked hermione still concentrating on her essay. “but i thought all the owls were being searched. so how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school?” “fred and george send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,” said hermione. “it’s part of their owl order service.” “you know a lot about it.” hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of advanced potion-making. “it was all on the back of the bottles they showed ginny and me in the summer,” she said coldly. “i don’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks ... or pretending to either which is just as bad. ...” “yeah well never mind that,” said harry quickly. “the point is filch is being fooled isn’t he these girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! so why couldn’t malfoy have brought the necklace into the school — ” “oh harry ... not that again ...” “come on why not?” demanded harry. “look,” sighed hermione “secrecy sensors detect jinxes curses and concealment charms don’t they they’re used to find dark magic and dark objects. they’d have picked up a powerful curse like the one on that necklace within seconds. but something that’s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway love potions aren’t dark or dangerous — ” “easy for you to say,” muttered harry thinking of romilda vane. “ — so it would be down to filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion and he’s not a very good wizard i doubt he can tell one potion from — ” hermione stopped dead harry had heard it too. somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. they waited and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of madam pince appeared around the corner her sunken cheeks her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying. “the library is now closed,” she said. “mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book you depraved boy?” “it isn’t the library’s it’s mine!” said harry hastily snatching his copy of advanced potion-making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. “despoiled!” she hissed. “desecrated! befouled!” “it’s just a book that’s been written on!” said harry tugging it out of her grip. she looked as though she might have a seizure hermione who had hastily packed her things grabbed harry by the arm and frogmarched him away. “she’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. why did you have to bring that stupid book?” “it’s not my fault she’s barking mad hermione. or d’you think she overheard you being rude about filch i’ve always thought there might be something going on between them. ...” “oh ha ha ...” enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again they made their way along the deserted lamp lit corridors back to the common room arguing about whether or not filch and madam pince were secretly in love with each other. “baubles,” said harry to the fat lady this being the new festive password. “same to you,” said the fat lady with a roguish grin and she swung forward to admit them. “hi harry!” said romilda vane the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. “fancy a gillywater?” hermione gave him a “what-did-i-tell-you?” look over her shoulder. “no thanks,” said harry quickly. “i don’t like it much.” “well take these anyway,” said romilda thrusting a box into his hands. “chocolate cauldrons they’ve got firewhisky in them. my gran sent them to me but i don’t like them.” “oh — right — thanks a lot,” said harry who could not think what else to say. “er — i’m just going over here with ...” he hurried off behind hermione his voice tailing away feebly. “told you,” said hermione succinctly. “sooner you ask someone sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can — ” but her face suddenly turned blank she had just spotted ron and lavender who were entwined in the same armchair. “well good night harry,” said hermione though it was only seven o’clock in the evening and she left for the girls’ dormitory without another word. harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through plus slughorn’s party after which he and ron would depart together for the burrow. it now seemed impossible that ron and hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began but perhaps somehow the break would give them time to calm down think better of their behavior. . . . but his hopes were not high and they sank still lower after enduring a transfiguration lesson with them both next day. they had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration working in front of mirrors they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. hermione laughed unkindly at ron’s disastrous first attempt during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time professor mcgonagall asked a question which lavender and parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced hermione to the verge of tears again. she raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her things behind harry deciding that her need was greater than ron’s just now scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her. he finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bathroom on the floor below. she was accompanied by luna lovegood who was patting her vaguely on the back. “oh hello harry,” said luna. “did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?” “hi luna. hermione you left your stuff. ...” he held out her books. “oh yes,” said hermione in a choked voice taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case. “thank you harry. well i’d better get going. ...” and she hurried off without giving harry any time to offer words of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any. “she’s a bit upset,” said luna. “i thought at first it was moaning myrtle in there but it turned out to be hermione. she said something about that ron weasley. ...” “yeah they’ve had a row,” said harry. “he says very funny things sometimes doesn’t he?” said luna as they set off down the corridor together. “but he can be a bit unkind. i noticed that last year.” “i s’pose,” said harry. luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths he had never met anyone quite like her. “so have you had a good term?” “oh it’s been all right,” said luna. “a bit lonely without the d.a. ginny’s been nice though. she stopped two boys in our transfiguration class calling me ‘loony’ the other day — ” “how would you like to come to slughorn’s party with me tonight?” the words were out of harry’s mouth before he could stop them he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise. “slughorn’s party with you?” “yeah,” said harry. “we’re supposed to bring guests so i thought you might like ... i mean ...” he was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. “i mean just as friends you know. but if you don’t want to ...” he was already half hoping that she didn’t want to. “oh no i’d love to go with you as friends!” said luna beaming as he had never seen her beam before. “nobody’s ever asked me to a party before as a friend! is that why you dyed your eyebrow for the party should i do mine too?” “no,” said harry firmly “that was a mistake. i’ll get hermione to put it right for me. so i’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.” “aha!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped unnoticed by either of them they had just passed right underneath peeves who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. “ potty asked loony to go to the partyl potty lurves loony ! potty luuuuurves looooooonyv’ and he zoomed away cackling and shrieking “potty loves loony!” “nice to keep these things private,” said harry. and sure enough in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that harry potter was taking luna lovegood to slughorn’s party. “you could’ve taken anyonel” said ron in disbelief over dinner. “anyonel and you chose loony lovegood?” “don’t call her that ron,” snapped ginny pausing behind harry on her way to join friends. “i’m really glad you’re taking her harry she’s so excited.” and she moved on down the table to sit with dean. harry tried to feel pleased that ginny was glad he was taking luna to the party but could not quite manage it. a long way along the table hermione was sitting alone playing with her stew. harry noticed ron looking at her furtively. “you could say sorry,” suggested harry bluntly. “what and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered ron. “what did you have to imitate her for?” “she laughed at my mustache!” “so did i it was the stupidest thing i’ve ever seen.” but ron did not seem to have heard lavender had just arrived with parvati. squeezing herself in between harry and ron lavender flung her arms around ron’s neck. “hi harry,” said parvati who like him looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. “hi,” said harry. “how’re you you’re staying at hogwarts then i heard your parents wanted you to leave.” “i managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said parvati. “that katie thing really freaked them out but as there hasn’t been anything since ... oh hi hermione!” parvati positively beamed. harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at hermione in transfiguration. he looked around and saw that hermione was beaming back if possible even more brightly. girls were very strange sometimes. “hi parvati!” said hermione ignoring ron and lavender completely. “are you going to slughorn’s party tonight?” “no invite,” said parvati gloomily. “i’d love to go though it sounds like it’s going to be really good. ... you’re going aren’t you?” “yes i’m meeting cormac at eight and we’re — ” there was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and ron surfaced. hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. “ — we’re going up to the party together.” “cormac?” said parvati. “cormac mclaggen you mean?” “that’s right,” said hermione sweetly. “the one who almost ’ — she put a great deal of emphasis on the word — “became gryffindor keeper.” “are you going out with him then?” asked parvati wide-eyed. “oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said hermione with a most un-hermione-ish giggle. “no!” said parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip. “wow you like your quidditch players don’t you first krum then mclaggen ...” “i like really good quidditch players,” hermione corrected her still smiling. “well see you ... got to go and get ready for the party. ...” she left. at once lavender and parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development with everything they had ever heard about mclaggen and all they had ever guessed about hermione. ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. when he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached luna. she was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers but otherwise she looked quite nice. harry was glad in any case that she had left off her radish earrings her butterbeer cork necklace and her spectrespecs. “hi,” he said. “shall we get going then?” “oh yes,” she said happily. “where is the party?” “slughorn’s office,” said harry leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. “did you hear there’s supposed to be a vampire coming?” “rufus scrimgeour?” asked luna. “i — what?” said harry disconcerted. “you mean the minister of magic?” “yes he’s a vampire,” said luna matter-of-factly. “father wrote a very long article about it when scrimgeour first took over from cornelius fudge but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the ministry. obviously they didn’t want the truth to get out!” harry who thought it most unlikely that rufus scrimgeour was a vampire but who was used to luna repeating her father’s bizarre views as though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter music and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. whether it had been built that way or because he had used magical trickery to make it so slughorn’s office was much larger than the usual teacher’s study. the ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald crimson and gold hangings so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. the room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering each a brilliant speck of light. loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing so that they looked like little roving tables. “harry m’boy!” boomed slughorn almost as soon as harry and luna had squeezed in through the door. “come in come in so many people i’d like you to meet!” slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. gripping harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to disapparate with him slughorn led him purposefully into the party harry seized luna’s hand and dragged her along with him. “harry i’d like you to meet eldred worple an old student of mine author of blood brothers my life amongst the vampires — and of course his friend sanguini.” worple who was a small stout bespectacled man grabbed harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically the vampire sanguini who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes merely nodded. he looked rather bored. a gaggle of girls was standing close to him looking curious and excited. “harry potter i am simply delighted!” said worple peering shortsightedly up into harry’s face. “i was saying to professor slughorn only the other day ‘where is the biography of harry potter for which we have all been waiting?’ ” “er,” said harry “were you?” “just as modest as horace described!” said worple. “but seriously” — his manner changed it became suddenly businesslike — “i would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about you dear boy craving! if you were prepared to grant me a few interviews say in four or five-hour sessions why we could have the book finished within months. and all with very little effort on your part i assure you — ask sanguini here if it isn’t quite — sanguini stay here\” added worple suddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls a rather hungry look in his eye. “here have a pasty,” said worple seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into sanguini’s hand before turning his attention back to harry. “my dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea — ” “i’m definitely not interested,” said harry firmly “and i’ve just seen a friend of mine sorry.” he pulled luna after him into the crowd he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the weird sisters. “hermione! hermionev’ “harry! there you are thank goodness! hi luna!” “what’s happened to you?” asked harry for hermione looked distinctly disheveled rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of devil’s snare. “oh i’ve just escaped — i mean i’ve just left cormac,” she said. “under the mistletoe,” she added in explanation as harry continued to look questioningly at her. “serves you right for coming with him,” he told her severely. “i thought he’d annoy ron most,” said hermione dispassionately. “i debated for a while about zacharias smith but i thought on the whole — ” “ you considered smith?” said harry revolted. “yes i did and i’m starting to wish i’d chosen him mclaggen makes grawp look a gentleman. let’s go this way we’ll be able to see him coming he’s so tall. the three of them made their way over to the other side of the room scooping up goblets of mead on the way realizing too late that professor trelawney was standing there alone. “hello,” said luna politely to professor trelawney. “good evening my dear,” said professor trelawney focusing upon luna with some difficulty. harry could smell cooking sherry again. “i haven’t seen you in my classes lately. ...” “no i’ve got firenze this year,” said luna. “oh of course,” said professor trelawney with an angry drunken titter. “or dobbin as i prefer to think of him. you would have thought would you not that now i am returned to the school professor dumbledore might have got rid of the horse but no ... we share classes. ... it’s an insult frankly an insult. do you know ...” professor trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized harry. under cover of her furious criticisms of firenze harry drew closer to hermione and said “let’s get something straight. are you planning to tell ron that you interfered at keeper tryouts?” hermione raised her eyebrows. “do you really think i’d stoop that low?” harry looked at her shrewdly. “hermione if you can ask out mclaggen — ” “there’s a difference,” said hermione with dignity. “i’ve got no plans to tell ron anything about what might or might not have happened at keeper tryouts.” “good,” said harry fervently. “because he’ll just fall apart again and we’ll lose the next match — ” “quidditch!” said hermione angrily. “is that all boys care about cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself no i’ve just been treated to ‘a hundred great saves made by cormac mclaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no here he comes!” she moved so fast it was as though she had disapparated one moment she was there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished. “seen hermione?” asked mclaggen forcing his way through the throng a minute later. “no sorry,” said harry and he turned quickly to join in luna’s conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking. “harry potter!” said professor trelawney in deep vibrant tones noticing him for the first time. “oh hello,” said harry unenthusiastically. “my dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. “the rumors! the stories! the chosen one’! of course i have known for a very long time. ... the omens were never good harry. . . . but why have you not returned to divination for you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance!” “ah sybill we all think our subject’s most important!” said a loud voice and slughorn appeared at professor trelawney’s other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “but i don’t think i’ve ever known such a natural at potions!” said slughorn regarding harry with a fond if bloodshot eye. “instinctive you know — like his mother! i’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability i can tell you that sybill — why even severus and to harry’s horror slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop snape out of thin air toward them. “stop skulking and come and join us severus!” hiccuped slughorn happily. “i was just talking about harry’s exceptional potion-making! some credit must go to you of course you taught him for five years!” trapped with slughorn’s arm around his shoulders snape looked down his hooked nose at harry his black eyes narrowed. “funny i never had the impression that i managed to teach potter anything at all.” “well then it’s natural ability!” shouted slughorn. “you should have seen what he gave me first lesson draught of living death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt i don’t think even you severus — ” “really?” said snape quietly his eyes still boring into harry who felt a certain disquiet. the last thing he wanted was for snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at potions. “remind me what other subjects you’re taking harry?” asked slughorn. “defense against the dark arts charms transfiguration herbology ...” “all the subjects required in short for an auror,” said snape with the faintest sneer. “yeah well that’s what i’d like to do,” said harry defiantly. “and a great one you’ll make too!” boomed slughorn. “i don’t think you should be an auror harry,” said luna unexpectedly. everybody looked at her. “the aurors are part of the rotfang conspiracy i thought everyone knew that. they’re working to bring down the ministry of magic from within using a combination of dark magic and gum disease.” harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh. really it had been worth bringing luna just for this. emerging from his goblet coughing sopping wet but still grinning he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher draco malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by argus filch. “professor slughorn,” wheezed filch his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes “i discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. he claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. did you issue him with an invitation?” malfoy pulled himself free of filch ’s grip looking furious. “all right i wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “i was trying to gatecrash happy?” “no i’m not!” said filch a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. “you’re in trouble you are! didn’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling’s out unless you’ve got permission didn’t he eh?” “that’s all right argus that’s all right,” said slughorn waving a hand. “it’s christmas and it’s not a crime to want to come to a party. just this once we’ll forget any punishment you may stay draco.” filch ’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable but why harry wondered watching him did malfoy look almost equally unhappy and why was snape looking at malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it possible ... a little afraid but almost before harry had registered what he had seen filch had turned and shuffled away muttering under his breath malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking slughorn for his generosity and snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again. “it’s nothing nothing,” said slughorn waving away malfoy ’s thanks. “i did know your grandfather after all. ...” “he always spoke very highly of you sir,” said malfoy quickly. “said you were the best potion-maker he’d ever known. ...” harry stared at malfoy. it was not the sucking-up that intrigued him he had watched malfoy do that to snape for a long time. it was the fact that malfoy did after all look a little ill. this was the first time he had seen malfoy close up for ages he now saw that malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin. “i’d like a word with you draco,” said snape suddenly. “oh now severus,” said slughorn hiccuping again “it’s christmas don’t be too hard — ” “i’m his head of house and i shall decide how hard or otherwise to be,” said snape curtly. “follow me draco.” they left snape leading the way malfoy looking resentful. harry stood there for a moment irresolute then said “i’ll be back in a bit luna — er — bathroom.” “all right,” she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her as he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the rotfang conspiracy with professor trelawney who seemed sincerely interested. it was easy once out of the party to pull his invisibility cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself for the corridor was quite deserted. what was more difficult was finding snape and malfoy. harry ran down the corridor the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from slughorn ’s office behind him. perhaps snape had taken malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the slytherin common room. ... harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. ... cannot afford mistakes draco because if you are expelled — ” “i didn’t have anything to do with it all right?” “i hope you are telling the truth because it was both clumsy and foolish. already you are suspected of having a hand in it.” “who suspects me?” said malfoy angrily. “for the last time i didn’t do it okay that bell girl must’ve had an enemy no one knows about — don’t look at me like that! i know what you’re doing i’m not stupid but it won’t work — i can stop you!” there was a pause and then snape said quietly “ah . . . aunt bellatrix has been teaching you occlumency i see. what thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master draco?” “i’m not trying to conceal anything from him i just don’t want you butting in!” harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. ... what had happened to make malfoy speak to snape like this — snape toward whom he had always shown respect even liking “so that is why you have been avoiding me this term you have feared my interference you realize that had anybody else failed to come to my office when i had told them repeatedly to be there draco — ” “so put me in detention! report me to dumbledore!” jeered malfoy. there was another pause. then snape said “you know perfectly well that i do not wish to do either of those things.” “you’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!” “listen to me,” said snape his voice so low now that harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. “i am trying to help you. i swore to your mother i would protect you. i made the unbreakable vow draco — ” “looks like you 11 have to break it then because i don’t need your protection! it’s my job he gave it to me and i’m doing it i’ve got a plan and it’s going to work it’s just taking a bit longer than i thought it would!” “what is your plan?” “it’s none of your business!” “if you tell me what you are trying to do i can assist you — ” “i’ve got all the assistance i need thanks i’m not alone!” “you were certainly alone tonight which was foolish in the extreme wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup these are elementary mistakes — “i would’ve had crabbe and goyle with me if you hadn’t put them in detention!” “keep your voice down!” spat snape for malfoy’s voice had risen excitedly. “if your friends crabbe and goyle intend to pass their defense against the dark arts o.w.l. this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres — ” “what does it matter?” said malfoy. “defense against the dark arts — it’s all just a joke isn’t it an act like any of us need protecting against the dark arts “it is an act that is crucial to success draco!” said snape. “where do you think i would have been all these years if i had not known how to act now listen to me! you are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like crabbe and goyle — ” “they’re not the only ones i’ve got other people on my side better people!” “then why not confide in me and i can — ” “i know what you’re up to! you want to steal my glory!” there was another pause then snape said coldly “you are speaking like a child. i quite understand that your father’s capture and imprisonment has upset you but — ” harry had barely a second’s warning he heard malfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open malfoy was striding away down the corridor past the open door of slughorn’s office around the distant corner and out of sight. hardly daring to breathe harry remained crouched down as snape emerged slowly from the classroom. his expression unfathomable he returned to the party. harry remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing. a very frosty christmas “so snape was offering to help him he was definitely offering to help him?” “if you ask that once more,” said harry “i’m going to stick this sprout — ” “i’m only checking!” said ron. they were standing alone at the burrow’s kitchen sink peeling a mountain of sprouts for mrs. weasley. snow was drifting past the window in front of them. “yes snape was offering to help himl” said harry. “he said he’d promised malfoy’s mother to protect him that he’d made an unbreakable oath or something — “an unbreakable vow?” said ron looking stunned. “nah he can’t have. ... are you sure?” “yes i’m sure,” said harry. “why what does it mean?” “well you can’t break an unbreakable vow. ...” “i’d worked that much out for myself funnily enough. what happens if you break it then?” “you die,” said ron simply. “fred and george tried to get me to make one when i was about five. i nearly did too i was holding hands with fred and everything when dad found us. he went mental,” said ron with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “only time i’ve ever seen dad as angry as mum. fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.” “yeah well passing over fred’s left buttock — ” “i beg your pardon?” said fred’s voice as the twins entered the kitchen. “aaah george look at this. they’re using knives and everything. bless them.” “i’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said ron grumpily “and then i’ll be able to do it by magic!” “but meanwhile,” said george sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it “we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a — whoops-a-daisy!” “you made me do that!” said ron angrily sucking his cut thumb. “you wait when i’m seventeen — ” “i’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,” yawned fred. “and speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills ronald,” said george “what is this we hear from ginny about you and a young lady called — unless our information is faulty — lavender brown?” ron turned a little pink but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. “mind your own business.” “what a snappy retort,” said fred. “i really don’t know how you think of them. no what we wanted to know was . . . how did it happen?” “what d’you mean?” “did she have an accident or something?” “what?” “well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage careful now!” mrs. weasley entered the room just in time to see ron throw the sprout knife at fred who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand. “ronl” she said furiously. “don’t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!” “i won’t,” said ron “let you see,” he added under his breath as he turned back to the sprout mountain. “fred george i’m sorry dears but remus is arriving tonight so bill will have to squeeze in with you two.” “no problem,” said george. “then as charlie isn’t coming home that just leaves harry and ron in the attic and if fleur shares with ginny — ” “ — that’ll make ginny’s christmas — ” muttered fred. “ — everyone should be comfortable. well they’ll have a bed anyway,” said mrs. weasley sounding slightly harassed. “percy definitely not showing his ugly face then?” asked fred. mrs. weasley turned away before she answered. “no he’s busy i expect at the ministry.” “or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said fred as mrs. weasley left the kitchen. “one of the two. well let’s get going then george.” “what are you two up to?” asked ron. “can’t you help us with these sprouts you could just use your wand and then well be free too!” “no i don’t think we can do that,” said fred seriously. “it’s very character-building stuff learning to peel sprouts without magic makes you appreciate how difficult it is for muggles and squibs — ” “ — and if you want people to help you ron,” added george throwing the paper airplane at him “i wouldn’t chuck knives at them. just a little hint. we’re off to the village there’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic. “gits,” said ron darkly watching fred and george setting off across the snowy yard. “would’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too.” “i couldn’t,” said harry. “i promised dumbledore i wouldn’t wander off while i’m staying here.” “oh yeah,” said ron. he peeled a few more sprouts and then said “are you going to tell dumbledore what you heard snape and malfoy saying to each other?” “yep,” said harry. “i’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and dumbledore’s top of the list. i might have another word with your dad too.” “pity you didn’t hear what malfoy’s actually doing though.” “i couldn’t have done could i that was the whole point he was refusing to tell snape.” there was silence for a moment or two then ron said “ ’course you know what they’ll all say dad and dumbledore and all of them they’ll say snape isn’t really trying to help malfoy he was just trying to find out what malfoy’s up to.” “they didn’t hear him,” said harry flatly. “no one’s that good an actor not even snape.” “yeah ... i’m just saying though,” said ron. harry turned to face him frowning. “you think i’m right though?” “yeah i do!” said ron hastily. “seriously i do! but they’re all convinced snape’s in the order aren’t they?” harry said nothing. it had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence he could hear hermione now obviously harry he was pretending to offer help so he could trick malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. ... this was pure imagination however as he had had no opportunity to tell hermione what he had overheard. she had disappeared from slughorn’s parry before he returned to it or so he had been informed by an irate mclaggen and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. as he and ron had left for the burrow early the next day he had barely had time to wish her a happy christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. he was not entirely sure that she had heard him though ron and lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time. still even hermione would not be able to deny one thing malfoy was definitely up to something and snape knew it so harry felt fully justified in saying “i told you so,” which he had done several times to ron already. harry did not get the chance to speak to mr. weasley who was working very long hours at the ministry until christmas eve night. the weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room which ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. fred george harry and ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for christmas dinner. stupefied painted gold stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back it glowered down at them all the ugliest angel harry had ever seen with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. they were all supposed to be listening to a christmas broadcast by mrs. weasley’s favorite singer celestina warbeck whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. fleur who seemed to find celestina very dull was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling mrs. weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control so that celestina grew louder and louder. under cover of a particularly jazzy number called “a cauldron full of hot strong love,” fred and george started a game of exploding snap with ginny. ron kept shooting bill and fleur covert looks as though hoping to pick up tips. meanwhile remus lupin who was thinner and more ragged looking than ever was sitting beside the fire staring into its depths as though he could not hear celestina’s voice. oh come and stir my cauldron and if you do it right i’ll boil you up some hot strong love to keep you warm tonight. “we danced to this when we were eighteen!” said mrs. weasley wiping her eyes on her knitting. “do you remember arthur?” “mphf?” said mr. weasley whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. “oh yes . . . marvelous tune ...” with an effort he sat up a little straighter and looked around at harry who was sitting next to him. “sorry about this,” he said jerking his head toward the wireless as celestina broke into the chorus. “be over soon.” “no problem,” said harry grinning. “has it been busy at the ministry?” “very,” said mr. weasley. “i wouldn’t mind if we were getting anywhere but of the three arrests we’ve made in the last couple of months i doubt that one of them is a genuine death eater — only don’t repeat that harry,” he added quickly looking much more awake all of a sudden. “they’re not still holding stan shunpike are they?” asked harry. “i’m afraid so,” said mr. weasley. “i know dumbledore’s tried appealing directly to scrimgeour about stan. ... i mean anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a death eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they’re making some progress and ‘three arrests’ sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases’... but again this is all top secret. ...” “i won’t say anything,” said harry. he hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say as he marshaled his thoughts celestina warbeck began a ballad called “you charmed the heart right out of me.” “mr. weasley you know what i told you at the station when we were setting off for school?” “i checked harry,” said mr. weasley at once. “i went and searched the malfoys’ house. there was nothing either broken or whole that shouldn’t have been there.” “yeah i know i saw in the prophet that you’d looked ... but this is something different. ... well something more ...” and he told mr. weasley everything he had overheard between malfoy and snape. as harry spoke he saw lupin’s head turn a little toward him taking in every word. when he had finished there was silence except for celestina’s crooning. oh my poor heart where has it gone it’s left me for a spell . . . “has it occurred to you harry,” said mr. weasley “that snape was simply pretending — ” “pretending to offer help so that he could find out what malfoy’s up to?” said harry quickly. “yeah i thought you’d say that. but how do we know?” “it isn’t our business to know,” said lupin unexpectedly. he had turned his back on the fire now and faced harry across mr. weasley. “it’s dumbledore’s business. dumbledore trusts severus and that ought to be good enough for all of us.” “but,” said harry “just say — just say dumbledore’s wrong about snape — ” “people have said it many times. it comes down to whether or not you trust dumbledore’s judgment. i do therefore i trust severus.” “but dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued harry. “he says it himself. and you” — he looked lupin straight in the eye — “do you honestly like snape?” “i neither like nor dislike severus,” said lupin. “no harry i am speaking the truth,” he added as harry pulled a skeptical expression. “we shall never be bosom friends perhaps after all that happened between james and sirius and severus there is too much bitterness there. but i do not forget that during the year i taught at hogwarts severus made the wolfsbane potion for me every month made it perfectly so that i did not have to suffer as i usually do at the full moon.” “but he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf so you had to leave!” said harry angrily. lupin shrugged. “the news would have leaked out anyway. we both know he wanted my job but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. he kept me healthy. i must be grateful.” “maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with dumbledore watching him!” said harry. “you are determined to hate him harry,” said lupin with a faint smile. “and i understand with james as your father with sirius as your godfather you have inherited an old prejudice. by all means tell dumbledore what you have told arthur and me but do not expect him to share your view of the matter do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. it might have been on dumbledore’s orders that severus questioned draco.” ... and now you’ve torn it quite apart i’ll thank you to give back my heart! celestina ended her song on a very long high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless which mrs. weasley joined in with enthusiastically. “eez eet over?” said fleur loudly. “thank goodness what an ’orrible — ” “shall we have a nightcap then?” asked mr. weasley loudly leaping to his feet. “who wants eggnog?” “what have you been up to lately?” harry asked lupin as mr. weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation. “oh i’ve been underground,” said lupin. “almost literally. that’s why i haven’t been able to write harry sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.” “what do you mean?” “i’ve been living among my fellows my equals,” said lupin. “werewolves,” he added at harry’s look of incomprehension. “nearly all of them are on voldemort’s side. dumbledore wanted a spy and here i was ... ready-made.” he sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly as he went on “i am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than i however it has been difficult gaining their trust. i bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins stealing — and sometimes killing — to eat.” “how come they like voldemort?” “they think that under his rule they will have a better life,” said lupin. “and it is hard to argue with grey back out there. ...” “who’s grey back?” “you haven’t heard of him?” lupin’s hands closed convulsively in his lap. “fenrir greyback is perhaps the most savage werewolf alive today. he regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. greyback specializes in children. ... bite them young he says and raise them away from their parents raise them to hate normal wizards. voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and daughters it is a threat that usually produces good results.” lupin paused and then said “it was greyback who bit me.” “what?” said harry astonished. “when — when you were a kid you mean?” “yes. my father had offended him. i did not know for a very long time the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me i even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transform. but greyback is not like that. at the full moon he positions himself close to victims ensuring that he is near enough to strike. he plans it all. and this is the man voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. i cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against greyback’s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.” “but you are normal!” said harry fiercely. “you’ve just got a — a problem — ” lupin burst out laughing. “sometimes you remind me a lot of james. he called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. many people were under the impression that i owned a badly behaved rabbit.” he accepted a glass of eggnog from mr. weasley with a word of thanks looking slightly more cheerful. harry meanwhile felt a rush of excitement this last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking lupin. “have you ever heard of someone called the half blood prince?” “the half-blood what?” “prince,” said harry watching him closely for signs of recognition. “there are no wizarding princes,” said lupin now smiling. “is this a title you’re thinking of adopting i should have thought being ‘the chosen one’ would be enough.” “it’s nothing to do with me!” said harry indignantly. “the half-blood prince is someone who used to go to hogwarts i’ve got his old potions book. he wrote spells all over it spells he invented. one of them was levicorpus — ” “oh that one had a great vogue during my time at hogwarts,” said lupin reminiscently. “there were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.” “my dad used it,” said harry. “i saw him in the pensieve he used it on snape.” he tried to sound casual as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect lupin’s smile was a little too understanding. “yes,” he said “but he wasn’t the only one. as i say it was very popular. ... you know how these spells come and go. ...” “but it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,” harry persisted. “not necessarily,” said lupin. “jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.” he looked into harry’s face and then said quietly “james was a pureblood harry and i promise you he never asked us to call him ‘prince.’ ” abandoning pretense harry said “and it wasn’t sirius or you?” “definitely not.” “oh.” harry stared into the fire. “i just thought — well he’s helped me out a lot in potions classes the prince has.” “how old is this book harry?” “i dunno i’ve never checked.” “well perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the prince was at hogwarts,” said lupin. shortly after this fleur decided to imitate celestina singing “a cauldron full of hot strong love,” which was taken by everyone once they had glimpsed mrs. weasley’s expression to be the cue to go to bed. harry and ron climbed all the way up to ron’s attic bedroom where a camp bed had been added for harry. ron fell asleep almost immediately but harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of advanced potion-making before getting into bed. there he turned its pages searching until he finally found at the front of the book the date that it had been published. it was nearly fifty years old. neither his father nor his father’s friends had been at hogwarts fifty years ago. feeling disappointed harry threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolves and snape stan shunpike and the half-blood prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. ... “she’s got to be joking. ...” harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. he put on his glasses and looked around the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain. “what’s that?” asked harry. “it’s from lavender,” said ron sounding revolted. “she can’t honestly think i’d wear ...” harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words my sweetheart “nice,” he said. “classy. you should definitely wear it in front of fred and george.” “if you tell them,” said ron shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow “i — i — 111 — ” “stutter at me?” said harry grinning. “come on would i?” “how could she think i’d like something like that though?” ron demanded of thin air looking rather shocked. “well think back,” said harry. “have you ever let it slip that you’d like to go out in public with the words ‘my sweetheart’ round your neck?” “well ... we don’t really talk much,” said ron. “it’s mainly ...” “snogging,” said harry. “well yeah,” said ron. he hesitated a moment then said “is hermione really going out with mclaggen?” “i dunno,” said harry. “they were at slughorn’s party together but i don’t think it went that well.” ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking. harry’s presents included a sweater with a large golden snitch worked onto the front hand-knitted by mrs. weasley a large box of weasleys’ wizard wheezes products from the twins and a slightly damp moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading to master from kreacher. harry stared at it. “d’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked. “can’t be anything dangerous all our mail’s still being searched at the ministry,” replied ron though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. “i didn’t think of giving kreacher anything. do people usually give their house-elves christmas presents?” asked harry prodding the parcel cautiously. “hermione would,” said ron. “but let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.” a moment later harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package contained a large number of maggots. “nice,” said ron roaring with laughter. “very thoughtful.” “i’d rather have them than that necklace,” said harry which sobered ron up at once. everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for christmas lunch everyone except fleur on whom it appeared mrs. weasley had not wanted to waste one and mrs. weasley herself who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds and a spectacular golden necklace. “fred and george gave them to me! aren’t they beautiful?” “well we find we appreciate you more and more mum now we’re washing our own socks,” said george waving an airy hand. “parsnips remus?” “harry you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said ginny cheerfully leaning across the table to pick it out harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot. “ ’ow ’orrible,” said fleur with an affected little shudder. “yes isn’t it?” said ron. “gravy fleur?” in his eagerness to help her he knocked the gravy boat flying bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. “you are as bad as zat tonks,” said fleur to ron when she had finished kissing bill in thanks. “she is always knocking — ” “i invited dear tonks to come along today,” said mrs. weasley setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at fleur. “but she wouldn’t come. have you spoken to her lately remus?” “no i haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said lupin. “but tonks has got her own family to go to hasn’t she?” “hmmm,” said mrs. weasley. “maybe. i got the impression she was planning to spend christmas alone actually.” she gave lupin an annoyed look as though it was all his fault she was getting fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of tonks but harry glancing across at fleur who was now feeding bill bits of turkey off her own fork thought that mrs. weasley was fighting a long lost battle. he was however reminded of a question he had with regard to tonks and who better to ask than lupin the man who knew all about patronuses “tonks’s patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “snape said so anyway. i didn’t know that could happen. why would your patronus change?” lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly “sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional upheaval ...” “it looked big and it had four legs,” said harry struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. “hey ... it couldn’t be — ” “arthur!” said mrs. weasley suddenly. she had risen from her chair her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. “arthur — it’s percy!” “what?” mr. weasley looked around. everybody looked quickly at the window ginny stood up for a better look. there sure enough was percy weasley striding across the snowy yard his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. he was not however alone. “arthur he’s — he’s with the minister!” and sure enough the man harry had seen in the daily prophet was following along in percy’s wake limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. before any of them could say anything before mr. and mrs. weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks the back door opened and there stood percy. there was a moment’s painful silence. then percy said rather stiffly “merry christmas mother.” “oh percy\” said mrs. weasley and she threw herself into his arms. rufus scrimgeour paused in the doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene. “you must forgive this intrusion,” he said when mrs. weasley looked around at him beaming and wiping her eyes. “percy and i were in the vicinity — working you know — and he couldn’t resist dropping in and seeing you all.” but percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. he stood poker-straight and awkward-looking and stared over everybody else’s heads. mr. weasley fred and george were all observing him stony-faced. “please come in sit down minister!” fluttered mrs. weasley straightening her hat. “have a little purkey or some tooding. ... i mean — ” “no no my dear molly,” said scrimgeour. harry guessed that he had checked her name with percy before they entered the house. “i don’t want to intrude wouldn’t be here at all if percy hadn’t wanted to see you all so badly. ...” “oh perce!” said mrs. weasley tearfully reaching up to kiss him. ... we’ve only looked in for five minutes so i’ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with percy. no no i assure you i don’t want to butt in! well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . ah that young man’s finished why doesn’t he take a stroll with me?” the atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. everybody looked from scrimgeour to harry. nobody seemed to find scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know harry’s name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the minister around the garden when ginny fleur and george also had clean plates. “yeah all right,” said harry into the silence. he was not fooled for all scrimgeour’s talk that they had just been in the area that percy wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they had come so that scrimgeour could speak to harry alone. “it’s fine,” he said quietly as he passed lupin who had half risen from his chair. “fine,” he added as mr. weasley opened his mouth to speak. “wonderful!” said scrimgeour standing back to let harry pass through the door ahead of him. “we’ll just take a turn around the garden and percy and i’ll be off. carry on everyone!” harry walked across the yard toward the weasleys’ overgrown snow-covered garden scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. he had harry knew been head of the auror office he looked tough and battle-scarred very different from portly fudge in his bowler hat. “charming,” said scrimgeour stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. “charming.” harry said nothing. he could tell that scrimgeour was watching him. “i’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said scrimgeour after a few moments. “did you know that?” “no,” said harry truthfully. “oh yes for a very long time. but dumbledore has been very protective of you,” said scrimgeour. “natural of course natural after what you’ve been through. ... especially what happened at the ministry he waited for harry to say something but harry did not oblige so he went on “i have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since i gained office but dumbledore has — most understandably as i say — prevented this.” still harry said nothing waiting. “the rumors that have flown around!” said scrimgeour. “well of course we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy ... of you being ‘the chosen one’...” they were getting near it now harry thought the reason scrimgeour was here. ... i assume that dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?” harry deliberated wondering whether he ought to lie or not. he looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds and the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the christmas tree. finally he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it. “yeah we’ve discussed it.” “have you have you ...” said scrimgeour. harry could see out of the corner of his eye scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. “and what has dumbledore told you harry?” “sorry but that’s between us,” said harry. he kept his voice as pleasant as he could and scrimgeour’s tone too was light and friendly as he said “oh of course if it’s a question of confidences i wouldn’t want you to divulge ... no no ... and in any case does it really matter whether you are ‘the chosen one’ or not?” ” harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding. “i don’t really know what you mean minister.” “well of course to you it will matter enormously,” said scrimgeour with a laugh. “but to the wizarding community at large ... it’s all perception isn’t it it’s what people believe that’s important.” harry said nothing. he thought he saw dimly where they were heading but he was not going to help scrimgeour get there. the gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. “people believe you are ‘the chosen one,’ you see,” said scrimgeour. “they think you quite the hero — which of course you are harry chosen or not! how many times have you faced he-who-must-not-be named now well anyway,” he pressed on without waiting for a reply “the point is you are a symbol of hope for many harry. the idea that there is somebody out there who might be able who might even be destined to destroy he-who-must-not-be named — well naturally it gives people a lift. and i can’t help but feel that once you realize this you might consider it well almost a duty to stand alongside the ministry and give everyone a boost.” the gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. it was now tugging very hard on it trying to get it out of the frozen ground. harry was silent so long that scrimgeour said looking from harry to the gnome “funny little chaps aren’t they but what say you harry?” “i don’t exactly understand what you want,” said harry slowly. “ ‘stand alongside the ministry’ ... what does that mean?” “oh well nothing at all onerous i assure you,” said scrimgeour. “if you were to be seen popping in and out of the ministry from time to time for instance that would give the right impression. and of course while you were there you would have ample opportunity to speak to gawain robards my successor as head of the auror office. dolores umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an auror. well that could be arranged very easily. ...” harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach so dolores umbridge was still at the ministry was she “so basically,” he said as though he just wanted to clarify a few points “you’d like to give the impression that i’m working for the ministry?” “it would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved harry,” said scrimgeour sounding relieved that harry had cottoned on so quickly. “ the chosen one,’ you know ... it’s all about giving people hope the feeling that exciting things are happening. ...” “but if i keep running in and out of the ministry,” said harry still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly “won’t that seem as though i approve of what the ministry’s up to?” “well,” said scrimgeour frowning slightly “well yes that’s partly why we’d like — ” “no i don’t think that’ll work,” said harry pleasantly. “you see i don’t like some of the things the ministry’s doing. locking up stan shunpike for instance.” scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. “i would not expect you to understand,” he said and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as harry had been. “these are dangerous times and certain measures need to be taken. you are sixteen years old “dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen and he doesn’t think stan should be in azkaban either,” said harry. “you’re making stan a scapegoat just like you want to make me a mascot.” they looked at each other long and hard. finally scrimgeour said with no pretense at warmth “i see. you prefer — like your hero dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the ministry?” “i don’t want to be used,” said harry. “some would say it’s your duty to be used by the ministry!” “yeah and others might say it’s your duty to check that people really are death eaters before you chuck them in prison,” said harry his temper rising now. “you’re doing what barty crouch did. you never get it right you people do you either we’ve got fudge pretending everything’s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or we’ve got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the chosen one’ working for you!” “so you’re not ‘the chosen one’?” said scrimgeour. “i thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said harry with a bitter laugh. “not to you anyway.” “i shouldn’t have said that,” said scrimgeour quickly. “it was tactless — ” “no it was honest,” said harry. “one of the only honest things you’ve said to me. you don’t care whether i live or die but you do care that i help you convince everyone you’re winning the war against voldemort. i haven’t forgotten minister. ...” he raised his right fist. there shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scars which dolores umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh must not tell lies. “i don’t remember you rushing to my defense when i was trying to tell everyone voldemort was back. the ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.” they stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. the gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush. “what is dumbledore up to?” said scrimgeour brusquely. “where does he go when he is absent from hogwarts?” “no idea,” said harry. “and you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said scrimgeour “would you?” “no i wouldn’t,” said harry. “well then i shall have to see whether i can’t find out by other means.” “you can try,” said harry indifferently. “but you seem cleverer than fudge so i’d have thought you’d have learned from his mistakes. he tried interfering at hogwarts. you might have noticed he’s not minister anymore but dumbledore’s still headmaster. i’d leave dumbledore alone if i were you.” there was a long pause. “well it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,” said scrimgeour his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses. “dumbledore’s man through and through aren’t you potter?” “yeah i am,” said harry. “glad we straightened that out.” and turning his back on the minister of magic he strode back toward the house. a sluggish memory late in the afternoon a few days after new year harry ron and ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to hogwarts. the ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the floo network to return students quickly and safely to the school. only mrs. weasley was there to say good-bye as mr. weasley fred george bill and fleur were all at work. mrs. weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. admittedly it took very little to set her off lately she had been crying on and off ever since percy had stormed from the house on christmas day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip for which fred george and ginny all claimed credit). “don’t cry mum,” said ginny patting her on the back as mrs. weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “it’s okay. “yeah don’t worry about us,” said ron permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek “or about percy. he’s such a prat it’s not really a loss is it?” mrs. weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded harry in her arms. “promise me you’ll look after yourself. ... stay out of trouble. ...” “i always do mrs. weasley,” said harry. “i like a quiet life you know me.” she gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “be good then all of you. ...” harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted “hogwarts!” he had one last fleeting view of the weasleys’ kitchen and mrs. weasley’s tearful face before the flames engulfed him spinning very fast he caught blurred glimpses of other wizarding rooms which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look then he was slowing down finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in professor mcgonagall’s office. she barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate. “evening potter. try not to get too much ash on the carpet.” “no professor.” harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as ron came spinning into view. when ginny had arrived all three of them trooped out of mcgonagall’s office and off toward gryffindor tower. harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the burrow garden. in the distance he could see hagrid feeding buckbeak in front of his cabin. “baubles,” said ron confidently when they reached the fat lady who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice. “no,” she said. “what d’you mean ‘no’?” “there is a new password,” she said. “and please don’t shout.” “but we’ve been away how’re we supposed to — ” “harry! ginny!” hermione was hurrying toward them very pink-faced and wearing a cloak hat and gloves. “i got back a couple of hours ago i’ve just been down to visit hagrid and buck — i mean witherwings,” she said breathlessly. “did you have a good christmas?” “yeah,” said ron at once “pretty eventful rufus scrim — ” “i’ve got something for you harry,” said hermione neither looking at ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. “oh hang on — password. abstinence.” “precisely,” said the fat lady in a feeble voice and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole. “what’s up with her?” asked harry. “overindulged over christmas apparently,” said hermione rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. “she and her friend violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the charms corridor. anyway she rummaged in her pocket for a moment then pulled out a scroll of parchment with dumbledore’s writing on it. “great,” said harry unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. “i’ve got loads to tell him — and you. let’s sit down — ” but at that moment there was a loud squeal of “won won!” and lavender brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into ron’s arms. several onlookers sniggered hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said “there’s a table over here. ... coming ginny?” “no thanks i said i’d meet dean,” said ginny though harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. leaving ron and lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match harry led hermione over to the spare table. “so how was your christmas?” “oh fine,” she shrugged. “nothing special. how was it at won-won’s?” “i’ll tell you in a minute,” said harry. “look hermione can’t you — ” “no i can’t,” she said flatly. “so don’t even ask.” “i thought maybe you know over christmas — ” “it was the fat lady who drank a vat of five-hundred year old wine harry not me. so what was this important news you wanted to tell me?” she looked too fierce to argue with at that moment so harry dropped the subject of ron and recounted all that he had overheard between malfoy and snape. when he had finished hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said “don’t you think — ” “ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?” “well yes,” said hermione. “ron’s dad and lupin think so,” harry said grudgingly. “but this definitely proves malfoy’s planning something you can’t deny that.” “no i can’t,” she answered slowly. “and he’s acting on voldemort’s orders just like i said!” “hmm . . . did either of them actually mention voldemort’s name?” harry frowned trying to remember. “i’m not sure ... snape definitely said your master,’ and who else would that be?” “i don’t know,” said hermione biting her lip. “maybe his father?” she stared across the room apparently lost in thought not even noticing lavender tickling ron. “how’s lupin?” “not great,” said harry and he told her all about lupin’s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. “have you heard of this fenrir grey back?” “yes i have!” said hermione sounding startled. “and so have you harry!” “when history of magic you know full well i never listened ...” “no no not history of magic — malfoy threatened borgin with him!” said hermione. “back in knockturn alley don’t you remember he told borgin that grey back was an old family friend and that he’d be checking up on borgin’s progress!” harry gaped at her. “i forgot! but this proves malfoy’s a death eater how else could he be in contact with greyback and telling him what to do?” “it is pretty suspicious,” breathed hermione. “unless “oh come on,” said harry in exasperation “you can’t get round this one!” “well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat.” “you’re unbelievable you are,” said harry shaking his head. “we’ll see who’s right. ... you’ll be eating your words hermione just like the ministry. oh yeah i had a row with rufus scrimgeour as well. ...” and the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the minister of magic for hermione like ron thought that after all the ministry had put harry through the previous year they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now. the new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight. apparition lessons if you are seventeen years of age or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st august next you are eligible for a twelve-week course of apparition lessons from a ministry of magic apparition instructor. please sign below if you would like to participate. cost 12 galleons. harry and ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. ron was just taking out his quill to sign after hermione when lavender crept up behind him slipped her hands over his eyes and trilled “guess who won-won?” harry turned to see hermione stalking off he caught up with her having no wish to stay behind with ron and lavender but to his surprise ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. without a word hermione sped up to walk with neville. “so — apparition,” said ron his tone making it perfectly plain that harry was not to mention what had just happened. “should be a laugh eh?” “i dunno,” said harry. “maybe it’s better when you do it yourself i didn’t enjoy it much when dumbledore took me along for the ride.” “i forgot you’d already done it. ... i’d better pass my test first time,” said ron looking anxious. “fred and george did.” “charlie failed though didn’t he?” “yeah but charlie’s bigger than me” — ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla — “so fred and george didn’t go on about it much ... not to his face anyway ...” “when can we take the actual test?” “soon as we’re seventeen. that’s only march for me!” “yeah but you wouldn’t be able to apparate in here not in the castle ...” “not the point is it everyone would know i could apparate if i wanted.” ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of apparition. all that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will. “how cool will it be when we can just — ” seamus clicked his fingers to indicate disappearance. “me cousin fergus does it just to annoy me you wait till i can do it back ... he’ll never have another peaceful moment. ...” lost in visions of this happy prospect he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today’s charms lesson he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked professor flitwick flat on his face. “harry’s already apparated,” ron told a slightly abashed seamus after professor flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set seamus lines “i am a wizard not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “dum — er — someone took him. side-along apparition you know.” “whoa!” whispered seamus and he dean and neville put their heads a little closer to hear what apparition felt like. for the rest of the day harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of apparition. all of them seemed awed rather than put off when he told them how uncomfortable it was and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library so as to escape in time for his lesson with dumbledore. the lamps in dumbledore ’s office were lit the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames and the pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. dumbledore ’s hands lay on either side of it the right one as blackened and burnt looking as ever. it did not seem to have healed at all and harry wondered for perhaps the hundredth time what had caused such a distinctive injury but did not ask dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was in any case another subject he wanted to discuss. but before harry could say anything about snape and malfoy dumbledore spoke. “i hear that you met the minister of magic over christmas?” “yes,” said harry. “he’s not very happy with me.” “no,” sighed dumbledore. “he is not very happy with me either. we must try not to sink beneath our anguish harry but battle on.” harry grinned. “he wanted me to tell the wizarding community that the ministry’s doing a wonderful job.” dumbledore smiled. “it was fudge’s idea originally you know. during his last days in office when he was trying desperately to cling to his post he sought a meeting with you hoping that you would give him your support — ” “after everything fudge did last year?” said harry angrily. “after umbridge?” “i told cornelius there was no chance of it but the idea did not die when he left office. within hours of scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded that i arrange a meeting with you — ” “so that’s why you argued!” harry blurted out. “it was in the daily prophet” “the prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said dumbledore “if only accidentally. yes that was why we argued. well it appears that rufus found a way to corner you at last.” “he accused me of being ‘dumbledore ’s man through and through.’ ” “how very rude of him.” “i told him i was.” dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. behind harry fawkes the phoenix let out a low soft musical cry. to harry’s intense embarrassment he suddenly realized that dumbledore ’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery and stared hastily at his own knees. when dumbledore spoke however his voice was quite steady. “i am very touched harry.” “scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at hogwarts,” said harry still looking fixedly at his knees. “yes he is very nosy about that,” said dumbledore now sounding cheerful and harry thought it safe to look up again. “he has even attempted to have me followed. amusing really. he set dawlish to tail me. it wasn’t kind. i have already been forced to jinx dawlish once i did it again with the greatest regret.” “so they still don’t know where you go?” asked harry hoping for more information on this intriguing subject but dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “no they don’t and the time is not quite right for you to know either. now i suggest we press on unless there’s anything else — ” “there is actually sir,” said harry. “it’s about malfoy and snape.” “professor snape harry.” “yes sir. i overheard them during professor slughorn’s party ... well i followed them actually. ...” dumbledore listened to harry’s story with an impassive face. when harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments then said “thank you for telling me this harry but i suggest that you put it out of your mind. i do not think that it is of great importance.” “not of great importance?” repeated harry incredulously. “professor did you understand — ” “yes harry blessed as i am with extraordinary brainpower i understood everything you told me,” said dumbledore a little sharply. “i think you might even consider the possibility that i understood more than you did. again i am glad that you have confided in me but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.” harry sat in seething silence glaring at dumbledore. what was going on did this mean that dumbledore had indeed ordered snape to find out what malfoy was doing in which case he had already heard everything harry had just told him from snape or was he really worried by what he had heard but pretending not to be “so sir,” said harry in what he hoped was a polite calm voice “you definitely still trust — ” “i have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,” said dumbledore but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. “my answer has not changed.” “i should think not,” said a snide voice phineas nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. dumbledore ignored him. “and now harry i must insist that we press on. i have more important things to discuss with you this evening.” harry sat there feeling mutinous. how would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject if he insisted upon arguing the case against malfoy as though he had read harry’s mind dumbledore shook his head. “ah harry how often this happens even between the best of friends! each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!” “i don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant sir,” said harry stiffly. “well you are quite right because it is not,” said dumbledore briskly. “i have two more memories to show you this evening both obtained with enormous difficulty and the second of them is i think the most important i have collected.” harry did not say anything to this he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further. “so,” said dumbledore in a ringing voice “we meet this evening to continue the tale of tom riddle whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at hogwarts. you will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard that he refused my company on a trip to diagon alley and that i in turn warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school. “well the start of the school year arrived and with it came tom riddle a quiet boy in his secondhand robes who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. he was placed in slytherin house almost the moment that the sorting hat touched his head,” continued dumbledore waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the sorting hat sat ancient and unmoving. “how soon riddle learned that the famous founder of the house could talk to snakes i do not know — perhaps that very evening. the knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance. “however if he was frightening or impressing fellow slytherins with displays of parseltongue in their common room no hint of it reached the staff. he showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. as an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. he seemed polite quiet and thirsty for knowledge. nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.” “didn’t you tell them sir what he’d been like when you met him at the orphanage?” asked harry. “no i did not. though he had shown no hint of remorse it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. i chose to give him that chance.” dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at harry who had opened his mouth to speak. here again was dumbledore ’s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! but then harry remembered something. . . . “but you didn’t really trust him sir did you he told me . . . the riddle who came out of that diary said ‘dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.’ ” “let us say that i did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,” said dumbledore. “i had as i have already indicated resolved to keep a close eye upon him and so i did. i cannot pretend that i gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. he was very guarded with me he felt i am sure that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. he was careful never to reveal as much again but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement nor what mrs. cole had confided in me. however he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues. “as he moved up the school he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends i call them that for want of a better term although as i have already indicated riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. this group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. they were a motley collection a mixture of the weak seeking protection the ambitious seeking some shared glory and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. in other words they were the forerunners of the death eaters and indeed some of them became the first death eaters after leaving hogwarts. “rigidly controlled by riddle they were never detected in open wrongdoing although their seven years at hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked the most serious of which was of course the opening of the chamber of secrets which resulted in the death of a girl. as you know hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime. “i have not been able to find many memories of riddle at hogwarts,” said dumbledore placing his withered hand on the pensieve. “few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him they are too terrified. what i know i found out after he had left hogwarts after much painstaking effort after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking after searching old records and questioning muggle and wizard witnesses alike. “those whom i could persuade to talk told me that riddle was obsessed with his parentage. this is understandable of course he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. it seems that he searched in vain for some trace of tom riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room on the lists of prefects in the old school records even in the books of wizarding history. finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in hogwarts. i believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever assumed the identity of lord voldemort and began his investigations into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom you will remember he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death. “all he had to go upon was the single name ‘marvolo,’ which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name. finally after painstaking research through old books of wizarding families he discovered the existence of slytherin’s surviving line. in the summer of his sixteenth year he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his gaunt relatives. and now harry if you will stand ...” dumbledore rose and harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling pearly memory. “i was very lucky to collect this,” he said as he poured the gleaming mass into the pensieve. “as you will understand when we have experienced it. shall we?” harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness. it took him several seconds to recognize the place by which time dumbledore had landed beside him. the gaunts’ house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere harry had ever seen. the ceiling was thick with cobwebs the floor coated in grime moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. the only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. he was slumped in an armchair by the fire and harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. but then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left. the door creaked open. there on the threshold holding an old-fashioned lamp stood a boy harry recognized at once tall pale dark-haired and handsome — the teenage voldemort. voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. for a few seconds they looked at each other then the man staggered upright the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor. “you!” he bellowed. “you!” and he hurtled drunkenly at riddle wand and knife held aloft. “stop.” riddle spoke in parseltongue. the man skidded into the table sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. he stared at riddle. there was a long silence while they contemplated each other. the man broke it. “ you speak it?” “yes i speak it,” said riddle. he moved forward into the room allowing the door to swing shut behind him. harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for voldemort’s complete lack of fear. his face merely expressed disgust and perhaps disappointment. “where is marvolo?” he asked. “dead,” said the other. “died years ago didn’t he?” riddle frowned. “ who are you then?” “i’m morfin ain’t 1?” “ marvolo’ s son?” “ ’course i am then ...” morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face the better to see riddle and harry saw that he wore marvolo’s black-stoned ring on his right hand. “i thought you was that muggle,” whispered morfin. “ you look mighty like that muggle .” “what muggle?” said riddle sharply. “that muggle what my sister took a fancy to that muggle what lives in the big house over the way,” said morfin and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. “you look right like him. riddle. but he’s older now in ’e he’s older’n you now i think on it. ...” morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little still clutching the edge of the table for support. “he come back see,” he added stupidly. voldemort was gazing at morfin as though appraising his possibilities. now he moved a little closer and said “riddle came back?” “ar he left her and serve her right marrying filth\” said morfin spitting on the floor again. “robbed us mind before she ran off! where’s the locket eh where’s slytherin’s locket?” voldemort did not answer. morfin was working himself into a rage again he brandished his knife and shouted “dishonored us she did that little slut! and who’re you coming here and asking questions about all that it’s over innit. ... it’s over. ...” he looked away staggering slightly and voldemort moved forward. as he did so an unnatural darkness fell extinguishing voldemort’s lamp and morfin ’s candle extinguishing everything. ... dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around harry’s arm and they were soaring back into the present again. the soft golden light in dumbledore’s office seemed to dazzle harry’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness. “is that all?” said harry at once. “why did it go dark what happened?” “because morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,” said dumbledore gesturing harry back into his seat. “when he awoke next morning he was lying on the floor quite alone. marvolo’s ring had gone. “meanwhile in the village of little hangleton a maid was running along the high street screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house tom riddle senior and his mother and father. “the muggle authorities were perplexed. as far as i am aware they do not know to this day how the riddles died for the avada kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. ... the exception sits before me,” dumbledore added with a nod to harry’s scar. “the ministry on the other hand knew at once that this was a wizard’s murder. they also knew that a convicted muggle-hater lived across the valley from the riddle house a muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people. “so the ministry called upon morfin. they did not need to question him to use veritaserum or legilimency. he admitted to the murder on the spot giving details only the murderer could know. he was proud he said to have killed the muggles had been awaiting his chance all these years. he handed over his wand which was proved at once to have been used to kill the riddles. and he permitted himself to be led off to azkaban without a fight. all that disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had disappeared. ‘he’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his captors over and over again. ‘he’ll kill me for losing his ring. ’ and that apparently was all he ever said again. he lived out the remainder of his life in azkaban lamenting the loss of marvolo’s last heirloom and is buried beside the prison alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.” “so voldemort stole morfin’s wand and used it?” said harry sitting up straight. “that’s right,” said dumbledore. “we have no memories to show us this but i think we can be fairly sure what happened. voldemort stupefied his uncle took his wand and proceeded across the valley to ‘the big house over the way. ’ there he murdered the muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother and for good measure his muggle grandparents thus obliterating the last of the unworthy riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. then he returned to the gaunt hovel performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind laid morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner pocketed the ancient ring he wore and departed.” “and morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?” “never,” said dumbledore. “he gave as i say a full and boastful confession.” “but he had this real memory in him all the time!” “yes but it took a great deal of skilled legilimency to coax it out of him,” said dumbledore “and why should anybody delve further into morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime however i was able to secure a visit to morfin in the last weeks of his life by which time i was attempting to discover as much as i could about voldemort’s past. i extracted this memory with difficulty. when i saw what it contained i attempted to use it to secure morfin’s release from azkaban. before the ministry reached their decision however morfin had died.” “but how come the ministry didn’t realize that voldemort had done all that to morfin?” harry asked angrily. “he was underage at the time wasn’t he i thought they could detect underage magic!” “you are quite right — they can detect magic but not the perpetrator you will remember that you were blamed by the ministry for the hover charm that was in fact cast by — ” “dobby,” growled harry this injustice still rankled. “so if you’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house the ministry won’t know?” “they will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said dumbledore smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on harry’s face. “they rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring’s obedience while within their walls.” “well that’s rubbish,” snapped harry. “look what happened here look what happened to morfin!” “i agree,” said dumbledore. “whatever morfin was he did not deserve to die as he did blamed for murders he had not committed. but it is getting late and i want you to see this other memory before we part. ...” dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and harry fell silent at once remembering that dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the pensieve as though they had congealed slightly did memories go bad “this will not take long,” said dumbledore when he had finally emptied the phial. “we shall be back before you know it. once more into the pensieve then and harry fell again through the silver surface landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once. it was a much younger horace slughorn. harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of slughorn with thick shiny straw-colored hair quite disconcerting it looked as though he had had his head thatched though there was already a shiny galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. his mustache less massive than it was these days was gingery blond. he was not quite as rotund as the slughorn harry knew though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. his little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair one hand grasping a small glass of wine the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple. harry looked around as dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in slughorn ’s office. half a dozen boys were sitting around slughorn all on harder or lower seats than his and all in their mid-teens. harry recognized voldemort at once. his was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. his right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair with a jolt harry saw that he was wearing marvolo’s gold-and black ring he had already killed his father. “sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring?” he asked. “tom tom if i knew i couldn’t tell you,” said slughorn wagging a reproving sugar-covered finger at riddle though ruining the effect slightly by winking. “i must say i’d like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are.” riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. “what with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple by the way you’re quite right it is my favorite — ” as several of the boys tittered something very odd happened. the whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog so that harry could see nothing but the face of dumbledore who was standing beside him. then slughorn ’s voice rang out through the mist unnaturally loudly “ you’ll go wrong boy mark my words.” the fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. bewildered harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock. “good gracious is it that time already?” said slughorn. “you’d better get going boys or we’ll all be in trouble. lestrange i want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. same goes for you avery.” slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. voldemort however stayed behind. harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately wanting to be last in the room with slughorn. “look sharp tom,” said slughorn turning around and finding him still present. “you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect ...” “sir i wanted to ask you something.” “ask away then m’boy ask away. ...” “sir i wondered what you know about . . . about horcruxes?” and it happened all over again the dense fog filled the room so that harry could not see slughorn or voldemort at all only dumbledore smiling serenely beside him. then slughorn’s voice boomed out again just as it had done before. “i don’t know anything about horcruxes and i wouldn’t tell you if i did! now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning them again\” “well that’s that,” said dumbledore placidly beside harry. “time to go.” and harry’s feet left the floor to fall seconds later back onto the mg in front of dumbledore’s desk. “that’s all there is?” said harry blankly. dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all but he could not see what was so significant about it. admittedly the fog and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it was odd but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer. “as you might have noticed,” said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk “that memory has been tampered with.” “tampered with?” repeated harry sitting back down too. “certainly,” said dumbledore. “professor slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.” “but why would he do that?” “because i think he is ashamed of what he remembers,” said dumbledore. “he has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. it is as you will have noticed very crudely done and that is all to the good for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations. “and so for the first time i am giving you homework harry. it will be your job to persuade professor slughorn to divulge the real memory which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.” harry stared at him. “but surely sir,” he said keeping his voice as respectful as possible “you don’t need me — you could use legilimency ... or veritaserum. ...” “professor slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,” said dumbledore. “he is much more accomplished at occlumency than poor morfin gaunt and i would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to veritaserum with him ever since i coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection. “no i think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from professor slughorn by force and might do much more harm than good i do not wish him to leave hogwarts. however he has his weaknesses like the rest of us and i believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. it is most important that we secure the true memory harry. ... how important we will only know when we have seen the real thing. so good luck ... and good night.” a little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal harry got to his feet quickly. “good night sir.” as he closed the study door behind him he distinctly heard phineas nigellus say “i can’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you dumbledore.” “i wouldn’t expect you to phineas,” replied dumbledore and fawkes gave another low musical cry. birthday surprises the next day harry confided in both ron and hermione the task that dumbledore had set him though separately for hermione still refused to remain in ron’s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look. ron thought that harry was unlikely to have any trouble with slughorn at all. “he loves you,” he said over breakfast waving an airy forkful of fried egg. “won’t refuse you anything will he not his little potions prince. just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.” hermione however took a gloomier view. “he must be determined to hide what really happened if dumbledore couldn’t get it out of him,” she said in a low voice as they stood in the deserted snowy courtyard at break. “horcruxes ... horcruxes ... i’ve never even heard of them. ...” “you haven’t?” harry was disappointed he had hoped that hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what horcruxes were. “they must be really advanced dark magic or why would voldemort have wanted to know about them i think it’s going to be difficult to get the information harry you’ll have to be very careful about how you approach slughorn think out a strategy. ...” “ron reckons i should just hang back after potions this afternoon. ...” “oh well if won-won thinks that you’d better do it,” she said flaring up at once. “after all when has won won’s judgment ever been faulty?” “hermione can’t you — ” “ivo!” she said angrily and stormed away leaving harry alone and ankle-deep in snow. potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days seeing as harry ron and hermione had to share a desk. today hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to ernie and ignored both harry and ron. “what’ve you done?” ron muttered to harry looking at hermione ’s haughty profile. but before harry could answer slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room. “settle down settle down please! quickly now lots of work to get through this afternoon! golpalott’s third law ... who can tell me —  but miss granger can of course!” hermione recited at top speed “golpalott’s-third law-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes for-each-of-the-separate-components.” “precisely!” beamed slughorn. “ten points for gryffindor! now if we accept golpalott’s third law as true ...” harry was going to have to take slughorn ’s word for it that golpalott’s third law was true because he had not understood any of it. nobody apart from hermione seemed to be following what slughorn said next either. ... which means of course that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion’s ingredients by scarpin’s revelaspell our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves but to find that added component that will by an almost alchemical process transform these disparate elements — ” ron was sitting beside harry with his mouth half open doodling absently on his new copy of advanced potion-making. ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on. ... and so,” finished slughorn “i want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. you are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. good luck and don’t forget your protective gloves!” hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward slughorn ’s desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move and by the time harry ron and ernie returned to the table she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it. “it’s a shame that the prince won’t be able to help you much with this harry,” she said brightly as she straightened up. “you have to understand the principles involved this time. no shortcuts or cheats!” annoyed harry uncorked the poison he had taken from slughorn’s desk which was a garish shade of pink tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. he did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. he glanced around at ron who was now standing there looking rather gormless having copied everything harry had done. “you sure the prince hasn’t got any tips?” ron muttered to harry. harry pulled out his trusty copy of advanced potion making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. there was golpalott’s third law stated word for word as hermione had recited it but not a single illuminating note in the prince’s hand to explain what it meant. apparently the prince like hermione had had no difficulty understanding it. “nothing,” said harry gloomily. hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. unfortunately they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. ernie macmillan however was muttering “specialis reveliol” over his cauldron which sounded impressive so harry and ron hastened to imitate him. it took harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did and instead had withdrawn his head hastily coughing as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. hermione’s expression could not have been any smugger she had loathed being outperformed in every potions class. she was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. more to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else harry bent over the half-blood prince’s book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force. and there it was scrawled right across a long list of antidotes just shove a bezoar down their throats. harry stared at these words for a moment. hadn’t he once long ago heard of bezoars hadn’t snape mentioned them in their first-ever potions lesson “a stone taken from the stomach of a goat which will protect from most poisons.” it was not an answer to the golpalott problem and had snape still been their teacher harry would not have dared do it but this was a moment for desperate measures. he hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found at the very back a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars. he opened the box just as slughorn called “two minutes left everyone!” inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. harry seized one put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron. “time’s ... up!” called slughorn genially. “well let’s see how you’ve done! blaise ... what have you got for me?” slowly slughorn moved around the room examining the various antidotes. nobody had finished the task although hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before slughorn reached her. ron had given up completely and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. harry stood there waiting the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. slughorn reached their table last. he sniffed ernie’s potion and passed on to ron’s with a grimace. he did not linger over ron’s cauldron but backed away swiftly retching slightly. “and you harry,” he said. “what have you got to show me?” harry held out his hand the bezoar sitting on his palm. slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. harry wondered for a moment whether he was going to shout at him. then he threw back his head and roared with laughter. “you’ve got nerve boy!” he boomed taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. “oh you’re like your mother. ... well i can’t fault you. ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!” hermione who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose looked livid. her half-finished antidote comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair bubbled sluggishly behind slughorn who had eyes for nobody but harry. “and you thought of a bezoar all by yourself did you harry?” she asked through gritted teeth. “that’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!” said slughorn happily before harry could reply. “just like his mother she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making it’s undoubtedly from lily he gets it. ... yes harry yes if you’ve got a bezoar to hand of course that would do the trick . . . although as they don’t work on everything and are pretty rare it’s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes. ...” the only person in the room looking angrier than hermione was malfoy who harry was pleased to see had spilled something that looked like cat-sick over himself. before either of them could express their fury that harry had come top of the class by not doing any work however the bell rang. “time to pack up!” said slughorn. “and an extra ten points to gryffindor for sheer cheek!” still chuckling he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon. harry dawdled behind taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. neither ron nor hermione wished him luck as they left both looked rather annoyed. at last harry and slughorn were the only two left in the room. “come on now harry you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said slughorn affably snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon skin briefcase. “sir,” said harry reminding himself irresistibly of voldemort “i wanted to ask you something.” “ask away then my dear boy ask away. ...” “sir i wondered what you know about . . . about horcruxes?” slughorn froze. his round face seemed to sink in upon itself. he licked his lips and said hoarsely “what did you say?” “i asked whether you know anything about horcruxes sir. you see — ” “dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered slughorn. his voice had changed completely. it was not genial anymore but shocked terrified. he fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief mopping his sweating brow. “dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory. well hasn’t he?” “yes,” said harry deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie. “yes of course,” said slughorn quietly still dabbing at his white face. “of course ... well if you’ve seen that memory harry you’ll know that i don’t know anything — anything” — he repeated the word forcefully — “about horcruxes.” he seized his dragon-skin briefcase stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door. “sir,” said harry desperately “i just thought there might be a bit more to the memory — ” “did you?” said slughorn. “then you were wrong weren’t you wrong!” he bellowed the last word and before harry could say another word slammed the dungeon door behind him. neither ron nor hermione was at all sympathetic when harry told them of this disastrous interview. hermione was still seething at the way harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. ron was resentful that harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too. “it would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” said harry irritably. “look i had to try and soften him up so i could ask him about voldemort didn’t i oh will you get a grip\” he added in exasperation as ron winced at the sound of the name. infuriated by his failure and by ron’s and hermione’s attitudes harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about slughorn. he decided that for the time being he would let slughorn think that he had forgotten all about horcruxes it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack. when harry did not question slughorn again the potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties determined to accept this time even if he had to reschedule quidditch practice. unfortunately however no such invitation arrived. harry checked with hermione and ginny neither of them had received an invitation and nor as far as they knew had anybody else. harry could not help wondering whether this meant that slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared simply determined to give harry no additional opportunities to question him. meanwhile the hogwarts library had failed hermione for the first time in living memory. she was so shocked she even forgot that she was annoyed at harry for his trick with the bezoar. “i haven’t found one single explanation of what horcruxes do!” she told him. “not a single one! i’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! all i could find was this in the introduction to magick moste evile — listen — ‘of the horcrux wickedest of magical inventions we shall not speak nor give direction. ...’i mean why mention it then?” she said impatiently slamming the old book shut it let out a ghostly wail. “oh shut up,” she snapped stuffing it back into her bag. the snow melted around the school as february arrived to be replaced by cold dreary wetness. purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. the upshot of this was that the sixth years’ first apparition lesson which was scheduled for a saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed took place in the great hall instead of in the grounds. when harry and hermione arrived in the hall ron had come down with lavender they found that the tables had disappeared. rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of professors mcgonagall snape flitwick and sprout — the heads of houses — and a small wizard whom harry took to be the apparition instructor from the ministry. he was oddly colorless with transparent eyelashes wispy hair and an insubstantial air as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. “good morning,” said the ministry wizard when all the students had arrived and the heads of houses had called for quiet. “my name is wilkie twycross and i shall be your ministry apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks. i hope to be able to prepare you for your apparition tests in this time — ” “malfoy be quiet and pay attention!” barked professor mcgonagall. everybody looked around. malfoy had flushed a dull pink he looked furious as he stepped away from crabbe with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. harry glanced quickly at snape who also looked annoyed though harry strongly suspected that this was less because of malfoy’s rudeness than the fact that mcgonagall had reprimanded one of his house. “ — by which time many of you may be ready to take your tests,” twycross continued as though there had been no interruption. “as you may know it is usually impossible to apparate or disapparate within hogwarts. the headmaster has lifted this enchantment purely within the great hall for one hour so as to enable you to practice. may i emphasize that you will not be able to apparate outside the walls of this hall and that you would be unwise to try. “i would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.” there was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated banged into each other and ordered others out of their space. the heads of houses moved among the students marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments. “harry where are you going?” demanded hermione. but harry did not answer he was moving quickly through the crowd past the place where professor flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few ravenclaws all of whom wanted to be near the front past professor sprout who was chivying the hufflepuffs into line until by dodging around ernie macmillan he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd directly behind malfoy who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with crabbe standing five feet away and looking mutinous. “i don’t know how much longer all right?” malfoy shot at him oblivious to harry standing right behind him. “it’s taking longer than i thought it would.” crabbe opened his mouth but malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say. “look it’s none of your business what i’m doing crabbe you and goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!” “i tell my friends what i’m up to if i want them to keep a lookout for me,” harry said just loud enough for malfoy to hear him. malfoy spun around on the spot his hand flying to his wand but at that precise moment the four heads of house shouted “quiet!” and silence fell again. malfoy turned slowly to face the front again. “thank you,” said twycross. “now then ...” he waved his wand. old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student. “the important things to remember when apparating are the three d’s!” said twycross. “destination determination deliberation! “step one fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,” said twycross. “in this case the interior of your hoop. kindly concentrate upon that destination now.” everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop then hastily did as they were told. harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. this proved impossible as he couldn’t stop puzzling over what malfoy was doing that needed lookouts. “step two,” said twycross “focus your determination to occupy the visualized space! let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!” harry glanced around surreptitiously. a little way to his left ernie macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink it looked as though he was straining to lay a quaffle-sized egg. harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop. “step three,” called twycross “and only when i give the command ... turn on the spot feeling your way into nothingness moving with deliberation ! on my command now . . . one — ” harry glanced around again lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to apparate so quickly. “— two — ” harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again he had already forgotten what the three d’s stood for. three!” harry spun on the spot lost balance and nearly fell over. he was not the only one. the whole hall was suddenly full of staggering people neville was flat on his back ernie macmillan on the other hand had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled until he caught sight of dean thomas roaring with laughter at him. “never mind never mind,” said twycross dryly who did not seem to have expected anything better. “adjust your hoops please and back to your original positions. ...” the second attempt was no better than the first. the third was just as bad. not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. there was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around terrified to see susan bones of hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started. the heads of house converged on her there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke which cleared to reveal susan sobbing reunited with her leg but looking horrified. “splinching or the separation of random body parts,” said wilkie twycross dispassionately “occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. you must concentrate continuously upon your destination  and move without haste but with deliberation ... thus.” twycross stepped forward turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes reappearing at the back of the hall. “remember the three d’s,” he said “and try again ... one — two — three — ” but an hour later susan’s splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. twycross did not seem discouraged. fastening his cloak at his neck he merely said “until next saturday everybody and do not forget destination. determination. deliberation.” with that he waved his wand vanishing the hoops and walked out of the hall accompanied by professor mcgonagall. talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall. “how did you do?” asked ron hurrying toward harry. “i think i felt something the last time i tried — a kind of tingling in my feet.” “i expect your trainers are too small won-won,” said a voice behind them and hermione stalked past smirking. “i didn’t feel anything,” said harry ignoring this interruption. “but i don’t care about that now — ” “what d’you mean you don’t care don’t you want to learn to apparate?” said ron incredulously. “i’m not fussed really i prefer flying,” said harry glancing over his shoulder to see where malfoy was and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall. “look hurry up will you there’s something i want to do. ...” perplexed ron followed harry back to the gryffindor tower at a run. they were temporarily detained by peeves who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants but harry and ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. within five minutes they were climbing through the portrait hole. “are you going to tell me what we’re doing then?” asked ron panting slightly. “up here,” said harry and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys’ staircase. their dormitory was as harry had hoped empty. he flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it while ron watched impatiently. “harry ...” “malfoy ’s using crabbe and goyle as lookouts. he was arguing with crabbe just now. i want to know — aha.” he had found it a folded square of apparently blank parchment which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand. “i solemnly swear that i am up to no good ... or malfoy is anyway.” at once the marauder’s map appeared on the parchment’s surface. here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and moving around it the tiny labeled black dots that signified each of the castle’s occupants. “help me find malfoy,” said harry urgently. he laid the map upon his bed and he and ron leaned over it searching. “there!” said ron after a minute or so. “he’s in the slytherin common room look . . . with parkinson and zabini and crabbe and goyle ...” harry looked down at the map disappointed but rallied almost at once. “well i’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he said firmly. “and the moment i see him lurking somewhere with crabbe and goyle keeping watch outside it’ll be on with the old invisibility cloak and off to find out what he’s — ” he broke off as neville entered the dormitory bringing with him a strong smell of singed material and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. despite his determination to catch malfoy out harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. although he consulted the map as often as he could sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it he did not once see malfoy anywhere suspicious. admittedly he spotted crabbe and goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors but at these times malfoy was not only nowhere near them but impossible to locate on the map at all. this was most mysterious. harry toyed with the possibility that malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds but could not see how he could be doing it given the very high level of security now operating within the castle. he could only suppose that he was missing malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. as for the fact that malfoy crabbe and goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable these things happened as people got older — ron and hermione harry reflected sadly were living proof. february moved toward march with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. to general indignation a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next trip into hogsmeade had been canceled. ron was furious. “it was on my birthday!” he said. “i was looking forward to that!” “not a big surprise though is it?” said harry. “not after what happened to katie.” she had still not returned from st. mungo’s. what was more further disappearances had been reported in the daily prophet including several relatives of students at hogwarts. “but now all i’ve got to look forward to is stupid apparition!” said ron grumpily. “big birthday treat ...” three lessons on apparition was proving as difficult as ever though a few more people had managed to splinch themselves. frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward wilkie twycross and his three d’s which had inspired a number of nicknames for him the politest of which were dogbreath and dunghead. “happy birthday ron,” said harry when they were woken on the first of march by seamus and dean leaving noisily for breakfast. “have a present.” he threw the package across onto ron’s bed where it joined a small pile of them that must harry assumed have been delivered by house-elves in the night. “cheers,” said ron drowsily and as he ripped off the paper harry got out of bed opened his own trunk and began rummaging in it for the marauder’s map which he hid after every use. he turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion felix felicis. “right,” he murmured taking it back to bed with him tapping it quietly and murmuring “ i solemnly swear that i am up to no good,” so that neville who was passing the foot of his bed at the time would not hear. “nice one harry!” said ron enthusiastically waving the new pair of quidditch keeper’s gloves harry had given him. “no problem,” said harry absentmindedly as he searched the slytherin dormitory closely for malfoy. “hey ... i don’t think he’s in his bed. ...” ron did not answer he was too busy unwrapping presents every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. “seriously good haul this year!” he announced holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. “see what mum and dad got me blimey i think i’ll come of age next year too. ...” “cool,” muttered harry sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. where was malfoy he did not seem to be at the slytherin table in the great hall eating breakfast. ... he was nowhere near snape who was sitting in his study. ... he wasn’t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing. ... “want one?” said ron thickly holding out a box of chocolate cauldrons. “no thanks,” said harry looking up. “malfoy’s gone again!” “can’t have done,” said ron stuffing a second cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. “come on if you don’t hurry up you’ll have to apparate on an empty stomach. ... might make it easier i suppose ...” ron looked thoughtfully at the box of chocolate cauldrons then shrugged and helped himself to a third. harry tapped the map with his wand muttered “mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been and got dressed thinking hard. there had to be an explanation for malfoy’s periodic disappearances but he simply could not think what it could be. the best way of finding out would be to tail him but even with the invisibility cloak this was an impractical idea harry had lessons quidditch practice homework and apparition he could not follow malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon. “ready?” he said to ron. he was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that ron had not moved but was leaning on his bedpost staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face. “ron breakfast.” “i’m not hungry.” harry stared at him. “i thought you just said — ” “well all right i’ll come down with you,” sighed ron “but i don’t want to eat.” harry scrutinized him suspiciously. “you’ve just eaten half a box of chocolate cauldrons haven’t you?” “it’s not that,” ron sighed again. “you ... you wouldn’t understand.” “fair enough,” said harry albeit puzzled as he turned to open the door. “harry!” said ron suddenly. “what?” “harry i can’t stand it!” “you can’t stand what?” asked harry now starting to feel definitely alarmed. ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. “i can’t stop thinking about her!” said ron hoarsely. harry gaped at him. he had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. friends they might be but if ron started calling lavender “lav-lav,” he would have to put his foot down. “why does that stop you having breakfast?” harry asked trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. “i don’t think she knows i exist,” said ron with a desperate gesture. “she definitely knows you exist,” said harry bewildered. “she keeps snogging you doesn’t she?” ron blinked. “who are you talking about?” “who are you talking about?” said harry with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. “romilda vane,” said ron softly and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. they stared at each other for almost a whole minute before harry said “this is a joke right you’re joking.” “i think ... harry i think i love her,” said ron in a strangled voice. “okay,” said harry walking up to ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion “okay... say that again with a straight face.” “i love her,” repeated ron breathlessly. “have you seen her hair it’s all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes her big dark eyes and her — ” “this is really funny and everything,” said harry impatiently “but joke’s over all right drop it.” he turned to leave he had got two steps toward the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. staggering he looked around. ron’s fist was drawn right back his face was contorted with rage he was about to strike again. harry reacted instinctively his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought levicorpus ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more he dangled helplessly upside down his robes hanging off him. “ what was that for?” harry bellowed. “you insulted her harry! you said it was a joke!” shouted ron who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head. “this is insane!” said harry. “what’s got into — ” and then he saw the box lying open on ron’s bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. “where did you get those chocolate cauldrons?” “they were a birthday present!” shouted ron revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. “i offered you one didn’t i?” “you just picked them up off the floor didn’t you?” “they’d fallen off my bed all right let me go!” “they didn’t fall off your bed you prat don’t you understand they were mine i chucked them out of my trunk when i was looking for the map they’re the chocolate cauldrons romilda gave me before christmas and they’re all spiked with love potion!” but only one word of this seemed to have registered with ron. “romilda?” he repeated. “did you say romilda harry — do you know her can you introduce me?” harry stared at the dangling ron whose face now looked tremendously hopeful and fought a strong desire to laugh. a part of him — the part closest to his throbbing right ear — was quite keen on the idea of letting ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off. . . . but on the other hand they were supposed to be friends ron had not been himself when he had attacked and harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted ron to declare undying love for romilda vane. “yeah i’ll introduce you,” said harry thinking fast. “i’m going to let you down now okay?” he sent ron crashing back to the floor his ear did hurt quite a lot but ron simply bounded to his feet again grinning. “she’ll be in slughorn’s office,” said harry confidently leading the way to the door. “why will she be in there?” asked ron anxiously hurrying to keep up. “oh she has extra potions lessons with him,” said harry inventing wildly. “maybe i could ask if i can have them with her?” said ron eagerly. “great idea,” said harry. lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole a complication harry had not foreseen. “you’re late won-won!” she pouted. “i’ve got you a birthday — ” “leave me alone,” said ron impatiently. “harry’s going to introduce me to romilda vane.” and without another word to her he pushed his way out of the portrait hole. harry tried to make an apologetic face to lavender but it might have turned out simply amused because she looked more offended than ever as the fat lady swung shut behind them. harry had been slightly worried that slughorn might be at breakfast but he answered his office door at the first knock wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed. “harry,” he mumbled. “this is very early for a call. ... i generally sleep late on a saturday. ...” “professor i’m really sorry to disturb you,” said harry as quietly as possible while ron stood on tiptoe attempting to see past slughorn into his room “but my friend ron’s swallowed a love potion by mistake. you couldn’t make him an antidote could you i’d take him to madam pomfrey but we’re not supposed to have anything from weasleys’ wizard wheezes and you know ... awkward questions ...” “i’d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy harry an expert potioneer like you?” asked slughorn. “er,” said harry somewhat distracted by the fact that ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room “well i’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion sir and by the time i get it right ron might’ve done something serious — ” helpfully ron chose this moment to moan “i can’t see her harry — is he hiding her?” “was this potion within date?” asked slughorn now eyeing ron with professional interest. “they can strengthen you know the longer they’re kept.” “that would explain a lot,” panted harry now positively wrestling with ron to keep him from knocking slughorn over. “it’s his birthday professor,” he added imploringly. “oh all right come in then come in,” said slughorn relenting. “i’ve got the necessary here in my bag it’s not a difficult antidote. ...” ron burst through the door into slughorn ’s overheated crowded study tripped over a tasseled footstool regained his balance by seizing harry around the neck and muttered “she didn’t see that did she?” “she’s not here yet,” said harry watching slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle. “that’s good,” said ron fervently. “how do i look?” “very handsome,” said slughorn smoothly handing ron a glass of clear liquid. “now drink that up it’s a tonic for the nerves keep you calm when she arrives you know.” “brilliant,” said ron eagerly and he gulped the antidote down noisily. harry and slughorn watched him. for a moment ron beamed at them. then very slowly his grin sagged and vanished to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror. “back to normal then?” said harry grinning. slughorn chuckled. “thanks a lot professor.” “don’t mention it m’boy don’t mention it,” said slughorn as ron collapsed into a nearby armchair looking devastated. “pick-me-up that’s what he needs,” slughorn continued now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. “i’ve got butterbeer i’ve got wine i’ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . . meant to give that to dumbledore for christmas ... ah well ...” he shrugged. “he can’t miss what he’s never had! why don’t we open it now and celebrate mr. weasley’s birthday nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. he chortled again and harry joined in. this was the first time he had found himself almost alone with slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. perhaps if he could just keep slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead . . . “there you are then,” said slughorn handing harry and ron a glass of mead each before raising his own. “well a very happy birthday ralph — ” “ron — ” whispered harry. but ron who did not appear to be listening to the toast had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it. there was one second hardly more than a heartbeat in which harry knew there was something terribly wrong and slughorn it seemed did not. “ — and may you have many more — ” “ron\” ron had dropped his glass he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled his extremities jerking uncontrollably. foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets. “professor!” harry bellowed. “do something!” but slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. ron twitched and choked his skin was turning blue. “what — but — ” spluttered slughorn. harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward slughorn ’s open potion kit pulling out jars and pouches while the terrible sound of ron’s gargling breath filled the room. then he found it — the shriveled kidneylike stone slughorn had taken from him in potions. he hurtled back to ron’s side wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. ron gave a great shudder a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still. elf tails “so all in all not one of ron’s better birthdays?” said fred. it was evening the hospital wing was quiet the windows curtained the lamps lit. ron’s was the only occupied bed. harry hermione and ginny were sitting around him they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. madam pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o’clock. fred and george had arrived at ten past. “this isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said george grimly putting down a large wrapped gift on ron’s bedside cabinet and sitting beside ginny. “yeah when we pictured the scene he was conscious,” said fred. “there we were in hogsmeade waiting to surprise him — ” said george. “you were in hogsmeade?” asked ginny looking up. “we were thinking of buying zonko’s,” said fred gloomily. “a hogsmeade branch you know but a fat lot of good it’ll do us if you lot aren’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore. ... but never mind that now.” he drew up a chair beside harry and looked at ron’s pale face. “how exactly did it happen harry?” harry retold the story he had already recounted it felt like a hundred times to dumbledore to mcgonagall to madam pomfrey to hermione and to ginny. ... and then i got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit slughorn ran for help mcgonagall and madam pomfrey turned up and they brought ron up here. they reckon he’ll be all right. madam pomfrey says hell have to stay here a week or so ... keep taking essence of rue ...” “blimey it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said george in a low voice. “lucky there was one in the room,” said harry who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone. hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. she had been exceptionally quiet all day. having hurtled white-faced up to harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened she had taken almost no part in harry and ginny’s obsessive discussion about how ron had been poisoned but merely stood beside them clench-jawed and frightened-looking until at last they had been allowed in to see him. “do mum and dad know?” fred asked ginny. “they’ve already seen him they arrived an hour ago — they’re in dumbledore’s office now but they’ll be back soon. ...” there was a pause while they all watched ron mumble a little in his sleep. “so the poison was in the drink?” said fred quietly. “yes,” said harry at once he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. “slughorn poured it out — ” “would he have been able to slip something into ron’s glass without you seeing?” “probably,” said harry “but why would slughorn want to poison ron?” “no idea,” said fred frowning. “you don’t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake meaning to get you?” “why would slughorn want to poison harry?” asked ginny. “i dunno,” said fred “but there must be loads of people who’d like to poison harry mustn’t there the chosen one’ and all that?” “so you think slughorn ’s a death eater?” said ginny. “anything’s possible,” said fred darkly. “he could be under the imperius curse,” said george. “or he could be innocent,” said ginny. “the poison could have been in the bottle in which case it was probably meant for slughorn himself.” “who’d want to kill slughorn?” “dumbledore reckons voldemort wanted slughorn on his side,” said harry. “slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to hogwarts. and ...” he thought of the memory dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from slughorn. “and maybe voldemort wants him out of the way maybe he thinks he could be valuable to dumbledore.” “but you said slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to dumbledore for christmas,” ginny reminded him. “so the poisoner could just as easily have been after dumbledore.” “then the poisoner didn’t know slughorn very well,” said hermione speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. “anyone who knew slughorn would have known there was a good chance he’d keep something that tasty for himself.” “er-my-nee,” croaked ron unexpectedly from between them. they all fell silent watching him anxiously but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring. the dormitory doors flew open making them all jump hagrid came striding toward them his hair rain-flecked his bearskin coat flapping behind him a crossbow in his hand leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor. “bin in the forest all day!” he panted. “aragog’s worse i bin readin’ to him — didn’ get up ter dinner till jus’ now an’ then professor sprout told me abou’ ron! how is he?” “not bad,” said harry. “they say he’ll be okay.” “no more than six visitors at a time!” said madam pomfrey hurrying out of her office. “hagrid makes six,” george pointed out. “oh ... yes ...” said madam pomfrey who seemed to have been counting hagrid as several people due to his vastness. to cover her confusion she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand. “i don’ believe this,” said hagrid hoarsely shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at ron. “jus’ don’ believe it ... look at him lyin’ there. ... who’d want ter hurt him eh?” “that’s just what we were discussing,” said harry. “we don’t know.” “someone couldn’ have a grudge against the gryffindor quidditch team could they?” said hagrid anxiously. “firs’ katie now ron ...” “i can’t see anyone trying to bump off a quidditch team,” said george. “wood might’ve done the slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,” said fred fairly. “well i don’t think it’s quidditch but i think there’s a connection between the attacks,” said hermione quietly. “how d’you work that out?” asked fred. “well for one thing they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t although that was pure luck. and for another neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed. of course,” she added broodingly “that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way because they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.” before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement the dormitory doors opened again and mr. and mrs. weasley hurried up the ward. they had done no more than satisfy themselves that ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward now mrs. weasley seized hold of harry and hugged him very tightly. “dumbledore’s told us how you saved him with the bezoar,” she sobbed. “oh harry what can we say you saved ginny ... you saved arthur ... now you’ve saved ron ...” “don’t be ... i didn’t ...” muttered harry awkwardly. “half our family does seem to owe you their lives now i stop and think about it,” mr. weasley said in a constricted voice. “well all i can say is that it was a lucky day for the weasleys when ron decided to sit in your compartment on the hogwarts express harry.” harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when madam pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around ron’s bed he and hermione rose at once to leave and hagrid decided to go with them leaving ron with his family. “it’s terrible,” growled hagrid into his beard as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase. “all this new security an’ kids are still gettin’ hurt. ... dumbledore’s worried sick. ... he don’ say much but i can tell. ...” “hasn’t he got any ideas hagrid?” asked hermione desperately. “i ’spect he’s got hundreds of ideas brain like his,” said hagrid. “but he doesn’ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine or they’d ’ve bin caught wouldn’ they wha’ worries me,” said hagrid lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder harry for good measure checked the ceiling for peeves “is how long hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein’ attacked. chamber o’ secrets all over again isn’ it there’ll be panic more parents takin’ their kids outta school an’ nex’ thing yeh know the board o’ governors ...” hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted serenely past then resumed in a hoarse whisper ... the board o’ governors’ll be talkin’ about shuttin’ us up fer good.” “surely not?” said hermione looking worried. “gotta see it from their point o’ view,” said hagrid heavily. “i mean it’s always bin a bit of a risk sendin’ a kid ter hogwarts hasn’ it yer expect accidents don’ yeh with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether but attempted murder tha’s diff’rent. ’s’no wonder dumbledore’s angry with sn — hagrid stopped in his tracks a familiar guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard. “what?” said harry quickly. “dumbledore’s angry with snape?” “i never said tha’,” said hagrid though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. “look at the time it’s gettin’ on fer midnight i need ter — ” “hagrid why is dumbledore angry with snape?” harry asked loudly. “shhhh!” said hagrid looking both nervous and angry. “don’ shout stuff like that harry d’yeh wan’ me ter lose me job mind i don’ suppose yeh’d care would yeh not now yeh’ve given up care of mag — ” “don’t try and make me feel guilty it won’t work!” said harry forcefully. “what’s snape done?” “i dunno harry i shouldn’ta heard it at all! i — well i was cornin’ outta the forest the other evenin’ an’ i overheard ’em talking — well arguin’. didn’t like ter draw attention to meself so i sorta skulked an’ tried not ter listen but it was a — well a heated discussion an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it out.” “well?” harry urged him as hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily. “well — i jus’ heard snape sayin’ dumbledore took too much fer granted an’ maybe he — snape — didn’ wan’ ter do it anymore — ” “do what?” “i dunno harry it sounded like snape was feelin’ a bit overworked tha’s all — anyway dumbledore told him flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there was to it. pretty firm with him. an’ then he said summat abou’ snape makin’ investigations in his house in slytherin. well there’s nothin’ strange abou’ that!” hagrid added hastily as harry and hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. “all the heads o’ houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business — ” “yeah but dumbledore ’s not having rows with the rest of them is he?” said harry. “look,” hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. “i know what yeh’re like abou’ snape harry an’ i don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter this than there is.” “look out,” said hermione tersely. they turned just in time to see the shadow of argus filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner hunchbacked his jowls aquiver. “oho!” he wheezed. “out of bed so late this’ll mean detention!” “no it won’ filch,” said hagrid shortly. “they’re with me aren’ they?” “and what difference does that make?” asked filch obnoxiously. “i’m a ruddy teacher aren’ i yeh sneakin’ squib!” said hagrid firing up at once. there was a nasty hissing noise as filch swelled with fury mrs. norris had arrived unseen and was twisting herself sinuously around filch’s skinny ankles. “get goin’,” said hagrid out of the corner of his mouth. harry did not need telling twice he and hermione both hurried off hagrid’s and filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. they passed peeves near the turning into gryffindor tower but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling cackling and calling when there’s strife and when there’s trouble call on peevsie he’ll make double! the fat lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. it did not seem that people knew about ron yet harry was very relieved he had been interrogated enough that day. hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls’ dormitory. harry however remained behind taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers. so dumbledore had argued with snape. in spite of all he had told harry in spite of his insistence that he trusted snape completely he had lost his temper with him. ... he did not think that snape had tried hard enough to investigate the slytherins ... or perhaps to investigate a single slytherin malfoy was it because dumbledore did not want harry to do anything foolish to take matters into his own hands that he had pretended there was nothing in harry’s suspicions that seemed likely. it might even be that dumbledore did not want anything to distract harry from their lessons or from procuring that memory from slughorn. perhaps dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen year-olds. ... “there you are potter!” harry jumped to his feet in shock his wand at the ready. he had been quite convinced that the common room was empty he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. a closer look showed him that it was cormac mclaggen. “i’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said mclaggen disregarding harry’s drawn wand. “must’ve fallen asleep. look i saw them taking weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. didn’t look like he’ll be fit for next week’s match.” it took harry a few moments to realize what mclaggen was talking about. “oh ... right ... quidditch,” he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. “yeah ... he might not make it.” “well then i’ll be playing keeper won’t i?” said mclaggen. “yeah,” said harry. “yeah i suppose so. ...” he could not think of an argument against it after all mclaggen had certainly performed second-best in the trials. “excellent,” said mclaggen in a satisfied voice. “so when’s practice?” “what oh ... there’s one tomorrow evening.” “good. listen potter we should have a talk beforehand. i’ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.” “right,” said harry unenthusiastically. “well i’ll hear them tomorrow then. i’m pretty tired now ... see you the news that ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day but it did not cause the sensation that katie’s attack had done. people seemed to think that it might have been an accident given that he had been in the potions master’s room at the time and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. in fact the gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming quidditch match against hufflepuff for many of them wanted to see zacharias smith who played chaser on the hufflepuff team punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against slytherin. harry however had never been less interested in quidditch he was rapidly becoming obsessed with draco malfoy. still checking the marauder’s map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detours to wherever malfoy happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. and still there were those inexplicable times when malfoy simply vanished from the map. ... but harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem what with quidditch practice homework and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by cormac mclaggen and lavender brown. he could not decide which of them was more annoying. mclaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent keeper for the team than ron and that now that harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide harry with detailed training schemes so that more than once harry was forced to remind him who was captain. meanwhile lavender kept sidling up to harry to discuss ron which harry found almost more wearing than mclaggen’s quidditch lectures. at first lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that ron was in the hospital wing — “i mean i am his girlfriend!” — but unfortunately she had now decided to forgive harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about ron’s feelings a most uncomfortable experience that harry would have happily forgone. “look why don’t you talk to ron about all this?” harry asked after a particularly long interrogation from lavender that took in everything from precisely what ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not harry thought that ron considered his relationship with lavender to be “serious.” “well i would but he’s always asleep when i go and see him!” said lavender fretfully. “is he?” said harry surprised for he had found ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of dumbledore and snape’s row and keen to abuse mclaggen as much as possible. “is hermione granger still visiting him?” lavender demanded suddenly. “yeah i think so. well they’re friends aren’t they?” said harry uncomfortably. “friends don’t make me laugh,” said lavender scornfully. “she didn’t talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! but i suppose she wants to make up with him now he’s all interesting. ...” “would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” asked harry. “anyway — sorry got to go — there’s mclaggen coming for a talk about quidditch,” said harry hurriedly and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to potions where thankfully neither lavender nor mclaggen could follow him. on the morning of the quidditch match against hufflepuff harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. ron was very agitated madam pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match feeling it would overexcite him. “so how’s mclaggen shaping up?” he asked harry nervously apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice. “i’ve told you,” said harry patiently “he could be world-class and i wouldn’t want to keep him. he keeps trying to tell everyone what to do he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. i can’t wait to be shot of him. and speaking of getting shot of people,” harry added getting to his feet and picking up his firebolt “will you stop pretending to be asleep when lavender comes to see you she’s driving me mad as well.” “oh,” said ron looking sheepish. “yeah. all right.” “if you don’t want to go out with her anymore just tell her,” said harry. “yeah ... well ... it’s not that easy is it?” said ron. he paused. “hermione going to look in before the match?” he added casually. “no she’s already gone down to the pitch with ginny.” “oh,” said ron looking rather glum. “right. well good luck. hope you hammer mclag — i mean smith.” “i’ll try,” said harry shouldering his broom. “see you after the match.” he hurried down through the deserted corridors the whole school was outside either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. he was looking out of the windows he passed trying to gauge how much wind they were facing when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw malfoy walking toward him accompanied by two girls both of whom looked sulky and resentful. malfoy stopped short at the sight of harry then gave a short humorless laugh and continued walking. “where ’re you going?” harry demanded. “yeah i’m really going to tell you because it’s your business potter,” sneered malfoy. “you’d better hurry up they’ll be waiting for ‘the chosen captain’ — ‘the boy who scored’ — whatever they call you these days.” one of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. harry stared at her. she blushed. malfoy pushed past harry and she and her friend followed at a trot turning the corner and vanishing from view. harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. this was infuriating he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was malfoy skulking off while the rest of the school was absent harry’s best chance yet of discovering what malfoy was up to. the silent seconds trickled past and harry remained where he was frozen gazing at the place where malfoy had vanished. ... “where have you been?” demanded ginny as harry sprinted into the changing rooms. the whole team was changed and ready coote and peakes the beaters were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs. “i met malfoy,” harry told her quietly as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head. “so?” “so i wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. ...” “does it matter right now?” “well i’m not likely to find out am i?” said harry seizing his firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. “come on then!” and without another word he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos. there was little wind the clouds were patchy every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight. “tricky conditions!” mclaggen said bracingly to the team. “coote peakes you’ll want to fly out of the sun so they don’t see you coming — ” “i’m the captain mclaggen shut up giving them instructions,” said harry angrily. “just get up by the goal posts!” once mclaggen had marched off harry turned to coote and peakes. “make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them grudgingly. he shook hands with the hufflepuff captain and then on madam hooch’s whistle kicked off and rose into the air higher than the rest of his team streaking around the pitch in search of the snitch. if he could catch it good and early there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle seize the marauder’s map and find out what malfoy was doing. “and that’s smith of hufflepuff with the quaffle,” said a dreamy voice echoing over the grounds. “he did the commentary last time of course and ginny weasley flew into him i think probably on purpose it looked like it. smith was being quite rude about gryffindor i expect he regrets that now he’s playing them — oh look he’s lost the quaffle ginny took it from him i do like her she’s very nice. ...” harry stared down at the commentator’s podium. surely nobody in their right mind would have let luna lovegood commentate but even from above there was no mistaking that long dirty-blonde hair nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. ... beside luna professor mcgonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment. ... but now that big hufflepuff player’s got the quaffle from her i can’t remember his name it’s something like bibble — no buggins — ” “it’s cadwallader!” said professor mcgonagall loudly from beside luna. the crowd laughed. harry stared around for the snitch there was no sign of it. moments later cadwallader scored. mclaggen had been shouting criticism at ginny for allowing the quaffle out of her possession with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear. “mclaggen will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!” bellowed harry wheeling around to face his keeper. “you’re not setting a great example!” mclaggen shouted back red-faced and furious. “and harry potter’s now having an argument with his keeper,” said luna serenely while both hufflepuffs and slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. “i don’t think that’ll help him find the snitch but maybe it’s a clever ruse. ...” swearing angrily harry spun round and set off around the pitch again scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny winged golden ball. ginny and demelza scored a goal apiece giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to cheer about. then cadwallader scored again making things level but luna did not seem to have noticed she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score and kept attempting to draw the crowd’s attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that zacharias smith who had so far failed to maintain possession of the quaffle for longer than a minute was suffering from something called “loser’s lurgy.” “seventy-forty to hufflepuff!” barked professor mcgonagall into luna’s megaphone. “is it already?” said luna vaguely. “oh look! the gryffindor keeper’s got hold of one of the beater’s bats.” harry spun around in midair. sure enough mclaggen for reasons best known to himself had pulled peakes ’s bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a bludger toward an oncoming cadwallader. “ will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!” roared harry pelting toward mclaggen just as mclaggen took a ferocious swipe at the bludger and mishit it. a blinding sickening pain ... a flash of light . . . distant screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel ... and the next thing harry knew he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. he raised his head awkwardly. there on his left was a familiar-looking freckly red-haired person. “nice of you to drop in,” said ron grinning. harry blinked and looked around. of course he was in the hospital wing. the sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. the match must have finished hours ago ... as had any hope of cornering malfoy. harry’s head felt strangely heavy he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages. “what happened?” “cracked skull,” said madam pomfrey bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. “nothing to worry about i mended it at once but i’m keeping you in overnight. you shouldn’t overexert yourself for a few hours.” “i don’t want to stay here overnight,” said harry angrily sitting up and throwing back his covers. “i want to find mclaggen and kill him.” “i’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘overexertion,’ ” said madam pomfrey pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. “you will stay here until i discharge you potter or i shall call the headmaster.” she bustled back into her office and harry sank back into his pillows fuming. “d’you know how much we lost by?” he asked ron through clenched teeth. “well yeah i do,” said ron apologetically. “final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty.” “brilliant,” said harry savagely. “really brilliant! when i get hold of mclaggen — ” “you don’t want to get hold of him he’s the size of a troll,” said ron reasonably. “personally i think there’s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the prince’s. anyway the rest of the team might’ve dealt with him before you get out of here they’re not happy. ...” there was a note of badly suppressed glee in ron’s voice harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that mclaggen had messed up so badly. harry lay there staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling his recently mended skull not hurting precisely but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging. “i could hear the match commentary from here,” said ron his voice now shaking with laughter. “i hope luna always commentates from now on. ... loser’s lurgy ...” but harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation and after a while ron’s snorts subsided. “ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said after a long pause and harry’s imagination zoomed into overdrive rapidly constructing a scene in which ginny weeping over his lifeless form confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while ron gave them his blessing. ... “she reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. how come you left here early enough.” “oh ...” said harry as the scene in his mind’s eye imploded. “yeah ... well i saw malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him and that’s the second time he’s made sure he isn’t down on the quidditch pitch with the rest of the school he skipped the last match too remember?” harry sighed. “wish i’d followed him now the match was such a fiasco. ...” “don’t be stupid,” said ron sharply. “you couldn’t have missed a quidditch match just to follow malfoy you’re the captain!” “i want to know what he’s up to,” said harry. “and don’t tell me it’s all in my head not after what i overheard between him and snape — ” “i never said it was all in your head,” said ron hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at harry “but there’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! you’re getting a bit obsessed with malfoy harry. i mean thinking about missing a match just to follow him ...” “i want to catch him at it!” said harry in frustration. “i mean where’s he going when he disappears off the map?” “i dunno . . . hogsmeade?” suggested ron yawning. “i’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map. i thought they were being watched now anyway?” “well then i dunno,” said ron. silence fell between them. harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him thinking. . . . if only he had rufus scrimgeour’s power he would have been able to set a tail upon malfoy but unfortunately harry did not have an office full of aurors at his command. ... he thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the d.a. but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons most of them after all still had full schedules. ... there was a low rumbling snore from ron’s bed. after a while madam pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown. it was easiest to feign sleep harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. the lamps dimmed and she returned to her office he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed. this was harry reflected in the darkness the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a quidditch injury. last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch and the time before that all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept professor lockhart. ... that had been his most painful injury by far ... he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the — harry sat bolt upright his heart pounding his bandage turban askew. he had the solution at last there was a way to have malfoy followed — how could he have forgotten why hadn’t he thought of it before but the question was how to call him what did you do quietly tentatively harry spoke into the darkness. “kreacher?” there was a very loud crack and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. ron awoke with a yelp. “what’s going — ” harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of madam pomfrey’s office and muttered “muffliatov’ so that she would not come running. then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on. two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats the other a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. then there was another loud bang and peeves the poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves. “i was watching that potty!” he told harry indignantly pointing at the fight below before letting out a loud cackle. “look at the ickle creatures squabbling bitey bitey punchy punchy — ” “kreacher will not insult harry potter in front of dobby no he won’t or dobby will shut kreacher’s mouth for him!” cried dobby in a high-pitched voice. “ — kicky scratchy!” cried peeves happily now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further. “tweaky pokey!” “kreacher will say what he likes about his master oh yes and what a master he is filthy friend of mudbloods oh what would poor kreacher’s mistress say — ” exactly what kreacher’s mistress would have said they did not find out for at that moment dobby sank his knobbly little fist into kreacher’s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. harry and ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart though they continued to try and kick and punch each other egged on by peeves who swooped around the lamp squealing “stick your fingers up his nosey draw his cork and pull his earsies — ” harry aimed his wand at peeves and said “langlockl” peeves clutched at his throat gulped then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth. “nice one,” said ron appreciatively lifting dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with kreacher. “that was another prince hex wasn’t it?” “yeah,” said harry twisting kreacher’s wizened arm into a half nelson. “right — i’m forbidding you to fight each other! well kreacher you’re forbidden to fight dobby. dobby i know i’m not allowed to give you orders — ” “dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and dobby will do whatever harry potter wants him to do!” said dobby tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper. “okay then,” said harry and he and ron both released the elves who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting. “master called me?” croaked kreacher sinking into a bow even as he gave harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death. “yeah i did,” said harry glancing toward madam pomfrey’s office door to check that the muffliato spell was still working there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. “i’ve got a job for you.” “kreacher will do whatever master wants,” said kreacher sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes “because kreacher has no choice but kreacher is ashamed to have such a master yes “dobby will do it harry potter!” squeaked dobby his tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in tears. “dobby would be honored to help harry potter!” “come to think of it it would be good to have both of you,” said harry. “okay then ... i want you to tail draco malfoy.” ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on ron’s face harry went on “i want to know where he’s going who he’s meeting and what he’s doing. i want you to follow him around the clock.” “yes harry potter!” said dobby at once his great eyes shining with excitement. “and if dobby does it wrong dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower harry potter!” “there won’t be any need for that,” said harry hastily. “master wants me to follow the youngest of the malfoys?” croaked kreacher. “master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress?” “that’s the one,” said harry foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately. “and you’re forbidden to tip him off kreacher or to show him what you’re up to or to talk to him at all or to write him messages or ... or to contact him in any way. got it?” he thought he could see kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited. after a moment or two and to harry’s great satisfaction kreacher bowed deeply again and said with bitter resentment “master thinks of everything and kreacher must obey him even though kreacher would much rather be the servant of the malfoy boy oh yes. ...” “that’s settled then,” said harry. “i’ll want regular reports but make sure i’m not surrounded by people when you turn up. ron and hermione are okay. and don’t tell anyone what you’re doing. just stick to malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.” lord voldemort’s request harry and ron left the hospital wing first thing on monday morning restored to full health by the ministrations of madam pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned the best of which was that hermione was friends with ron again. hermione even escorted them down to breakfast bringing with her the news that ginny had argued with dean. the drowsing creature in harry’s chest suddenly raised its head sniffing the air hopefully. “what did they row about?” he asked trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. she looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying. “it’s all right!” said hermione kindly hurrying forward to help her. “here ...” she tapped the broken scales with her wand and said “reparo.” the girl did not say thank you but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight ron glanced back at her. “i swear they’re getting smaller,” he said. “never mind her,” said harry a little impatiently. “what did ginny and dean row about hermione?” “oh dean was laughing about mclaggen hitting that bludger at you,” said hermione. “it must’ve looked funny,” said ron reasonably. “it didn’t look funny at all!” said hermione hotly. “it looked terrible and if coote and peakes hadn’t caught harry he could have been very badly hurt!” “yeah well there was no need for ginny and dean to split up over it,” said harry still trying to sound casual. “or are they still together?” “yes they are — but why are you so interested?” asked hermione giving harry a sharp look. “i just don’t want my quidditch team messed up again!” he said hastily but hermione continued to look suspicious and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called “harry!” giving him an excuse to turn his back on her. “oh hi luna.” “i went to the hospital wing to find you,” said luna rummaging in her bag. “but they said you’d left. ...” she thrust what appeared to be a green onion a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into ron’s hands finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to harry. ... i’ve been told to give you this.” it was a small roll of parchment which harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with dumbledore. “tonight,” he told ron and hermione once he had unrolled it. “nice commentary last match!” said ron to luna as she took back the green onion the toadstool and the cat litter. luna smiled vaguely. “you’re making fun of me aren’t you?” she said. “everyone says i was dreadful.” “no i’m serious!” said ron earnestly. “i can’t remember enjoying commentary more! what is this by the way?” he added holding the onionlike object up to eye level. “oh it’s a gurdyroot,” she said stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. “you can keep it if you like i’ve got a few of them. they’re really excellent for warding off gulping plimpies.” and she walked away leaving ron chortling still clutching the gurdyroot. “you know she’s grown on me luna,” he said as they set off again for the great hall. “i know she’s insane but it’s in a good — ” he stopped talking very suddenly. lavender brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. “hi,” said ron nervously. “c’mon,” harry muttered to hermione and they sped past though not before they had heard lavender say “why didn’t you tell me you were getting out today and why was she with you?” ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later and though he sat with lavender harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this but once or twice harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. all that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over in other words finish writing harry’s herbology essay something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point because she had known that harry would then let ron copy his work. “thanks a lot hermione,” said harry giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o’clock. “listen i’ve got to hurry or i’ll be late for dumbledore. ...” she did not answer but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. grinning harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmaster’s office. the gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs and harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight. “enter,” called dumbledore but as harry put out a hand to push the door it was wrenched open from inside. there stood professor trelawney. “aha!” she cried pointing dramatically at harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. “so this is the reason i am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office dumbledore!” “my dear sybill,” said dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice “there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere but harry does have an appointment and i really don’t think there is any more to be said — ” “very well,” said professor trelawney in a deeply wounded voice. “if you will not banish the usurping nag so be it. ... perhaps i shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. ...” she pushed past harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase they heard her stumble halfway down and harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls. “please close the door and sit down harry,” said dumbledore sounding rather tired. harry obeyed noticing as he took his usual seat in front of dumbledore ’s desk that the pensieve lay between them once more as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory. “professor trelawney still isn’t happy firenze is teaching then?” harry asked. “no,” said dumbledore “divination is turning out to be much more trouble than i could have foreseen never having studied the subject myself. i cannot ask firenze to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can i ask sybill trelawney to leave. between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. she does not know — and i think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy about you and voldemort you see.” dumbledore heaved a deep sigh then said “but never mind my staffing problems. we have much more important matters to discuss. firstly — have you managed the task i set you at the end of our previous lesson?” “ah,” said harry brought up short. what with apparition lessons and quidditch and ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what draco malfoy was up to harry had almost forgotten about the memory dumbledore had asked him to extract from professor slughorn. “well i asked professor slughorn about it at the end of potions sir but er he wouldn’t give it to me.” there was a little silence. “i see,” said dumbledore eventually peering at harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving harry the usual sensation that he was being x-rayed. “and you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter do you that you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity that you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?” “well,” harry stalled at a loss for what to say next. his single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. “well ... the day ron swallowed love potion by mistake i took him to professor slughorn. i thought maybe if i got professor slughorn in a good enough mood — ” “and did that work?” asked dumbledore. “well no sir because ron got poisoned — ” “ — which naturally made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory i would have expected nothing else while your best friend was in danger. once it became clear that mr. weasley was going to make a full recovery however i would have hoped that you returned to the task i set you. i thought i made it clear to you how very important that memory is. indeed i did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.” a hot prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of harry’s head all the way down his body. dumbledore had not raised his voice he did not even sound angry but harry would have preferred him to yell this cold disappointment was worse than anything. “sir,” he said a little desperately “it isn’t that i wasn’t bothered or anything i’ve just had other — other things ...” “other things on your mind,” dumbledore finished the sentence for him. “i see.” silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence harry had ever experienced with dumbledore it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of armando dippet over dumbledore ’s head. harry felt strangely diminished as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. when he could stand it no longer he said “professor dumbledore i’m really sorry. i should have done more. ... i should have realized you wouldn’t have asked me to do it if it wasn’t really important.” “thank you for saying that harry,” said dumbledore quietly. “may i hope then that you will give this matter higher priority from now on there will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.” “i’ll do it sir i’ll get it from him,” he said earnestly. “then we shall say no more about it just now,” said dumbledore more kindly “but continue with our story where we left off. you remember where that was?” “yes sir,” said harry quickly. “voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his uncle morfin did it. then he went back to hogwarts and he asked ... he asked professor slughorn about horcruxes,” he mumbled shamefacedly. “very good,” said dumbledore. “now you will remember i hope that i told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?” “yes sir.” “thus far as i hope you agree i have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what voldemort did until the age of seventeen?” harry nodded. “but now harry,” said dumbledore “now things become murkier and stranger. if it was difficult to find evidence about the boy riddle it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man voldemort. in fact i doubt whether there is a soul alive apart from himself who could give us a full account of his life since he left hogwarts. however i have two last memories that i would like to share with you.” dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the pensieve. “i shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions i have drawn from them seem likely.” the idea that dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the horcrux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat as dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it. “i hope you are not tired of diving into other people’s memories for they are curious recollections these two,” he said. “this first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of hokey. before we see what hokey witnessed i must quickly recount how lord voldemort left hogwarts. “he reached the seventh year of his schooling with as you might have expected top grades in every examination he had taken. all around him his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left hogwarts. nearly everybody expected spectacular things from tom riddle prefect head boy winner of the award for special services to the school. i know that several teachers professor slughorn amongst them suggested that he join the ministry of magic offered to set up appointments put him in touch with useful contacts. he refused all offers. the next thing the staff knew voldemort was working at borgin and burkes.” “at borgin and burkes?” harry repeated stunned. “at borgin and burkes,” repeated dumbledore calmly. “i think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered hokey’s memory. but this was not voldemort’s first choice of job. hardly anyone knew of it at the time — i was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided — but voldemort first approached professor dippet and asked whether he could remain at hogwarts as a teacher.” “he wanted to stay here why?” asked harry more amazed still. “i believe he had several reasons though he confided none of them to professor dippet,” said dumbledore. “firstly and very importantly voldemort was i believe more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. hogwarts was where he had been happiest the first and only place he had felt at home.” harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words for this was exactly how he felt about hogwarts too. “secondly the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. undoubtedly voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel stores of magic to tap. “and thirdly as a teacher he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. perhaps he had gained the idea from professor slughorn the teacher with whom he was on best terms who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. i do not imagine for an instant that voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at hogwarts but i do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.” “but he didn’t get the job sir?” “no he did not. professor dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen but invited him to reapply in a few years if he still wished to teach.” “how did you feel about that sir?” asked harry hesitantly. “deeply uneasy,” said dumbledore. “i had advised armando against the appointment — i did not give the reasons i have given you for professor dippet was very fond of voldemort and convinced of his honesty. but i did not want lord voldemort back at this school and especially not in a position of power.” “which job did he want sir what subject did he want to teach?” somehow harry knew the answer even before dumbledore gave it. “defense against the dark arts. it was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of galatea merrythought who had been at hogwarts for nearly fifty years. “so voldemort went off to borgin and burkes and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was a brilliant young wizard like that working in a shop. however voldemort was no mere assistant. polite and handsome and clever he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like borgin and burkes which specializes as you know harry in objects with unusual and powerful properties. voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners and he was by all accounts unusually gifted at doing this.” “i’ll bet he was,” said harry unable to contain himself. “well quite,” said dumbledore with a faint smile. “and now it is time to hear from hokey the house-elf who worked for a very old very rich witch by the name of hepzibah smith.” dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the pensieve saying as he did so “after you harry.” harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. he tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her giving her the look of a melting iced cake. she was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff while the tiniest and oldest house elf harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers. “hurry up hokey!” said hepzibah imperiously. “he said he’d come at four it’s only a couple of minutes to and he’s never been late yet!” she tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. the top of the elf’s head barely reached the seat of hepzibah ’s chair and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga. “how do i look?” said hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror. “lovely madam,” squeaked hokey. harry could only assume that it was down in hokey’s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question because hepzibah smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion. a tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped. “quick quick he’s here hokey!” cried hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things there were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes cases full of gold-embossed books shelves of orbs and celestial globes and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. in fact the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. the house-elf returned within minutes followed by a tall young man harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as voldemort. he was plainly dressed in a black suit his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed but all of this suited him he looked more handsome than ever. he picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over hepzibah ’s fat little hand brushing it with his lips. “i brought you flowers,” he said quietly producing a bunch of roses from nowhere. “you naughty boy you shouldn’t have!” squealed old hepzibah though harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. “you do spoil this old lady tom. ... sit down sit down. ... where’s hokey ah ...” the house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes which she set at her mistress’s elbow. “help yourself tom,” said hepzibah “i know how you love my cakes. now how are you you look pale. they overwork you at that shop i’ve said it a hundred times. ...” voldemort smiled mechanically and hepzibah simpered. “well what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she asked batting her lashes. “mr. burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,” said voldemort. “five hundred galleons he feels it is a more than fair — ” “now now not so fast or i’ll think you’re only here for my trinkets!” pouted hepzibah. “i am ordered here because of them,” said voldemort quietly. “i am only a poor assistant madam who must do as he is told. mr. burke wishes me to inquire “oh mr. burke phooey!” said hepzibah waving a little hand. “i’ve something to show you that i’ve never shown mr. burke! can you keep a secret tom will you promise you won’t tell mr. burke i’ve got it he’d never let me rest if he knew i’d shown it to you and i’m not selling not to burke not to anyone! but you tom you’ll appreciate it for its history not how many galleons you can get for it.” “i’d be glad to see anything miss hepzibah shows me,” said voldemort quietly and hepzibah gave another girlish giggle. “i had hokey bring it out for me. ... hokey where are you i want to show mr. riddle our finest treasure. ... in fact bring both while you’re at it. ...” “here madam,” squeaked the house-elf and harry saw two leather boxes one on top of the other moving across the room as if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables pouffes and footstools. “now,” said hepzibah happily taking the boxes from the elf laying them in her lap and preparing to open the topmost one “i think you’ll like this tom. ... oh if my family knew i was showing you. ... they can’t wait to get their hands on this!” she opened the lid. harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles. “i wonder whether you know what it is tom pick it up have a good look!” whispered hepzibah and voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. his greedy expression was curiously mirrored on hepzibah’s face except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon voldemort’s handsome features. “a badger,” murmured voldemort examining the engraving upon the cup. “then this was ... ” “helga hufflepuff’s as you very well know you clever boy!” said hepzibah leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. “didn’t i tell you i was distantly descended this has been handed down in the family for years and years. lovely isn’t it and all sorts of powers it’s supposed to possess too but i haven’t tested them thoroughly i just keep it nice and safe in here. ...” she hooked the cup back off voldemort’s long forefinger and restored it gently to its box too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed voldemort’s face as the cup was taken away. “now then,” said hepzibah happily “where’s hokey oh yes there you are — take that away now hokey.” the elf obediently took the boxed cup and hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap. “i think you’ll like this even more tom,” she whispered. “lean in a little dear boy so you can see. ...of course burke knows i’ve got this one i bought it from him and i daresay he’d love to get it back when i’m gone. ...” she slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. there upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket. voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light staring at it. “slytherin’s mark,” he said quietly as the light played upon an ornate serpentine s. “that’s right!” said hepzibah delighted apparently at the sight of voldemort gazing at her locket transfixed. “i had to pay an arm and a leg for it but i couldn’t let it pass not a real treasure like that had to have it for my collection. burke bought it apparently from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it but had no idea of its true value — ” there was no mistaking it this time voldemort’s eyes flashed scarlet at the words and harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket’s chain. “ — i daresay burke paid her a pittance but there you are. ... pretty isn’t it and again all kinds of powers attributed to it though i just keep it nice and safe. ...” she reached out to take the locket back. for a moment harry thought voldemort was not going to let go of it but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion. “so there you are tom dear and i hope you enjoyed that!” she looked him full in the face and for the first time harry saw her foolish smile falter. “are you all right dear?” “oh yes,” said voldemort quietly. “yes i’m very well. “i thought — but a trick of the light i suppose — ” said hepzibah looking unnerved and harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in voldemort’s eyes. “here hokey take these away and lock them up again. ... the usual enchantments ...” “time to leave harry,” said dumbledore quietly and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes dumbledore grasped harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to dumbledore ’s office. “hepzibah smith died two days after that little scene,” said dumbledore resuming his seat and indicating that harry should do the same. “hokey the house-elf was convicted by the ministry of poisoning her mistress’s evening cocoa by accident.” “no way!” said harry angrily. “i see we are of one mind,” said dumbledore. “certainly there are many similarities between this death and that of the riddles. in both cases somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death — ” “hokey confessed?” “she remembered putting something in her mistress’s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar but a lethal and little-known poison,” said dumbledore. “it was concluded that she had not meant to do it but being old and confused — ” “voldemort modified her memory just like he did with morfin!” “yes that is my conclusion too,” said dumbledore. “and just as with morfin the ministry was predisposed to suspect hokey — ” “ — because she was a house-elf,” said harry. he had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society hermione had set up s.p.e.w. “precisely,” said dumbledore. “she was old she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the ministry bothered to inquire further. as in the case of morfin by the time i traced her and managed to extract this memory her life was almost over — but her memory of course proves nothing except that voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket. “by the time hokey was convicted hepzibah’s family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. it took them a while to be sure of this for she had many hiding places having always guarded her collection most jealously. but before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone the assistant who had worked at borgin and burkes the young man who had visited hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well had resigned his post and vanished. his superiors had no idea where he had gone they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. and that was the last that was seen or heard of tom riddle for a very long time. “now,” said dumbledore “if you don’t mind harry i want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. voldemort had committed another murder whether it was his first since he killed the riddles i do not know but i think it was. this time as you will have seen he killed not for revenge but for gain. he wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor besotted old woman showed him. just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage just as he had stolen his uncle morfin ’s ring so he ran off now with hepzibah’s cup and locket.” “but,” said harry frowning “it seems mad. ... risking everything throwing away his job just for those ...” “mad to you perhaps but not to voldemort,” said dumbledore. “i hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him harry but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket at least as rightfully his.” “the locket maybe,” said harry “but why take the cup as well?” “it had belonged to another of hogwarts’s founders,” said dumbledore. “i think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in hogwarts history. there were other reasons i think. ... i hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course. “and now for the very last recollection i have to show you at least until you manage to retrieve professor slughorn’s memory for us. ten years separates hokey’s memory and this one ten years during which we can only guess at what lord voldemort was doing. harry got to his feet once more as dumbledore emptied the last memory into the pensieve. “whose memory is it?” he asked. “mine,” said dumbledore. and harry dived after dumbledore through the shifting silver mass landing in the very office he had just left. there was fawkes slumbering happily on his perch and there behind the desk was dumbledore who looked very similar to the dumbledore standing beside harry though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was perhaps a little less lined. the one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge. the younger dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something and sure enough moments after their arrival there was a knock on the door and he said “enter.” harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. voldemort had entered the room. his features were not those harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago they were not as snakelike the eyes were not yet scarlet the face not yet masklike and yet he was no longer handsome tom riddle. it was as though his features had been burned and blurred they were waxy and oddly distorted and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look though the pupils were not yet the slits that harry knew they would become. he was wearing a long black cloak and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders. the dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. evidently this visit had been made by appointment. “good evening tom,” said dumbledore easily. “won’t you sit down?” “thank you,” said voldemort and he took the seat to which dumbledore had gestured — the very seat by the looks of it that harry had just vacated in the present. “i heard that you had become headmaster,” he said and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. “a worthy choice.” “i am glad you approve,” said dumbledore smiling. “may i offer you a drink?” “that would be welcome,” said voldemort. “i have come a long way.” dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the pensieve but which then was full of bottles. having handed voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself he returned to the seat behind his desk. “so tom ... to what do i owe the pleasure?” voldemort did not answer at once but merely sipped his wine. “they do not call me tom’ anymore,” he said. “these days i am known as — ” “i know what you are known as,” said dumbledore smiling pleasantly. “but to me i’m afraid you will always be tom riddle. it is one of the irritating things about old teachers. i am afraid that they never quite forget their charges’ youthful beginnings.” he raised his glass as though toasting voldemort whose face remained expressionless. nevertheless harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly dumbledore’s refusal to use voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to allow voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting and harry could tell that voldemort took it as such. “i am surprised you have remained here so long,” said voldemort after a short pause. “i always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.” “well,” said dumbledore still smiling “to a wizard such as myself there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills helping hone young minds. if i remember correctly you once saw the attraction of teaching too.” “i see it still,” said voldemort. “i merely wondered why you — who are so often asked for advice by the ministry and who have twice i think been offered the post of minister — ” “three times at the last count actually,” said dumbledore. “but the ministry never attracted me as a career. again something we have in common i think.” voldemort inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine. dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now but waited with a look of pleasant expectancy for voldemort to talk first. “i have returned,” he said after a little while “later perhaps than professor dippet expected ... but i have returned nevertheless to request again what he once told me i was too young to have. i have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach. i think you must know that i have seen and done much since i left this place. i could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.” dumbledore considered voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking. “yes i certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us,” he said quietly. “rumors of your doings have reached your old school tom. i should be sorry to believe half of them.” voldemort ’s expression remained impassive as he said “greatness inspires envy envy engenders spite spite spawns lies. you must know this dumbledore.” “you call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing do you?” asked dumbledore delicately. “certainly,” said voldemort and his eyes seemed to burn red. “i have experimented i have pushed the boundaries of magic further perhaps than they have ever been pushed — ” “of some kinds of magic,” dumbledore corrected him quietly. “of some. of others you remain ... forgive me ... woefully ignorant.” for the first time voldemort smiled. it was a taut leer an evil thing more threatening than a look of rage. “the old argument,” he said softly. “but nothing i have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic dumbledore.” “perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” suggested dumbledore. “well then what better place to start my fresh researches than here at hogwarts?” said voldemort. “will you let me return will you let me share my knowledge with your students i place myself and my talents at your disposal. i am yours to command.” dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “and what will become of those whom you command what will happen to those who call themselves — or so rumor has it — the death eaters?” harry could tell that voldemort had not expected dumbledore to know this name he saw voldemort’s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare. “my friends,” he said after a moment’s pause “will carry on without me i am sure.” “i am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” said dumbledore. “i was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.” “you are mistaken,” said voldemort. “then if i were to go to the hog’s head tonight i would not find a group of them — nott rosier mulciber dolohov — awaiting your return devoted friends indeed to travel this far with you on a snowy night merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.” there could be no doubt that dumbledore ’s detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to voldemort however he rallied almost at once. “you are omniscient as ever dumbledore.” “oh no merely friendly with the local barmen,” said dumbledore lightly. “now tom ...” dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture. “let us speak openly. why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchmen to request a job we both know you do not want?” voldemort looked coldly surprised. “a job i do not want on the contrary dumbledore i want it very much.” “oh you want to come back to hogwarts but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. what is it you’re after tom why not try an open request for once?” voldemort sneered. “if you do not want to give me a job ” “of course i don’t,” said dumbledore. “and i don’t think for a moment you expected me to. nevertheless you came here you asked you must have had a purpose.” voldemort stood up. he looked less like tom riddle than ever his features thick with rage. “this is your final word?” “it is,” said dumbledore also standing. “then we have nothing more to say to each other.” “no nothing,” said dumbledore and a great sadness filled his face. “the time is long gone when i could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. but i wish i could tom. ... i wish i could. ...” for a second harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning he was sure that voldemort’s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand but then the moment had passed voldemort had turned away the door was closing and he was gone. harry felt dumbledore ’s hand close over his arm again and moments later they were standing together on almost the same spot but there was no snow building on the window ledge and dumbledore’s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more. “why?” said harry at once looking up into dumbledore’s face. “why did he come back did you ever find out?” “i have ideas,” said dumbledore “but no more than that.” “what ideas sir?” “i shall tell you harry when you have retrieved that memory from professor slughorn,” said dumbledore. “when you have that last piece of the jigsaw everything will i hope be clear ... to both of us.” harry was still burning with curiosity and even though dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him he did not move at once. “was he after the defense against the dark arts job again sir he didn’t say. ...” “oh he definitely wanted the defense against the dark arts job,” said dumbledore. “the aftermath of our little meeting proved that. you see we have never been able to keep a defense against the dark arts teacher for longer than a year since i refused the post to lord voldemort.” the unknowable room harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade slughorn to hand over the true memory but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss poring over his potions book hoping that the prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin as he had done so many times before. “you won’t find anything in there,” said hermione firmly late on sunday evening. “don’t start hermione,” said harry. “if it hadn’t been for the prince ron wouldn’t be sitting here now.” “he would if you’d just listened to snape in our first year,” said hermione dismissively. harry ignored her. he had just found an incantation “ sectumsempral” scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “for enemies,” and was itching to try it out but thought it best not to in front of hermione. instead he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. they were sitting beside the fire in the common room the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. there had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their apparition test. those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date the twenty-first of april had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions which would take place heavily supervised in hogsmeade. ron had panicked on reading this notice he had still not managed to apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. hermione who had now achieved apparition twice was a little more confident but harry who would not be seventeen for another four months could not take the test whether ready or not. “at least you can apparate though!” said ron tensely. “you’ll have no trouble come july!” “i’ve only done it once,” harry reminded him he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson. having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about apparition ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for snape that harry and hermione had already completed. harry fully expected to receive low marks on his because he had disagreed with snape on the best way to tackle dementors but he did not care slughorn’s memory was the most important thing to him now. ‘tm telling you the stupid prince isn’t going to be able to help you with this harry!” said hermione more loudly. “there’s only one way to force someone to do what you want and that’s the imperius curse which is illegal — ” “yeah i know that thanks,” said harry not looking up from the book. “that’s why i’m looking for something different. dumbledore says veritaserum won’t do it but there might be something else a potion or a spell. ...” “you’re going about it the wrong way,” said hermione. “only you can get the memory dumbledore says. that must mean you can persuade slughorn where other people can’t. it’s not a question of slipping him a potion anyone could do that — ” “how d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said ron shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. “it can’t be b — u — m — ” “no it isn’t,” said hermione pulling ron’s essay toward her. “and ‘augury’ doesn’t begin o — r — g either. what kind of quill are you using?” “it’s one of fred and george’s spell-check ones ... but i think the charm must be wearing off. ...” “yes it must,” said hermione pointing at the title of his essay “because we were asked how we’d deal with dementors not ‘dugbogs,’ and i don’t remember you changing your name to ‘roonil wazlib’ either.” “ah no!” said ron staring horror-struck at the parchment. “don’t say i’ll have to write the whole thing out again!” “it’s okay we can fix it,” said hermione pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand. “i love you hermione,” said ron sinking back in his chair rubbing his eyes wearily. hermione turned faintly pink but merely said “don’t let lavender hear you saying that.” “i won’t,” said ron into his hands. “or maybe i will ... then she’ll ditch me ...” “why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” asked harry. “you haven’t ever chucked anyone have you?” said ron. “you and cho just — ” “sort of fell apart yeah,” said harry “wish that would happen with me and lavender,” said ron gloomily watching hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand so that they corrected themselves on the page. “but the more i hint i want to finish it the tighter she holds on. it’s like going out with the giant squid.” “there,” said hermione some twenty minutes later handing back ron’s essay. “thanks a million,” said ron. “can i borrow your quill for the conclusion?” harry who had found nothing useful in the half blood prince’s notes so far looked around the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room seamus having just gone up to bed cursing snape and his essay. the only sounds were the crackling of the fire and ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using hermione’s quill. harry had just closed the half-blood prince’s book yawning when — crack. hermione let out a little shriek ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay and harry said “kreacher!” the house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. “master said he wanted regular reports on what the malfoy boy is doing so kreacher has come to give — ” crack. dobby appeared alongside kreacher his tea-cozy hat askew. “dobby has been helping too harry potter!” he squeaked casting kreacher a resentful look. “and kreacher ought to tell dobby when he is coming to see harry potter so they can make their reports together!” “what is this?” asked hermione still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. “what’s going on harry?” harry hesitated before answering because he had not told hermione about setting kreacher and dobby to tail malfoy house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her. “well ... they’ve been following malfoy for me,” he said. “night and day,” croaked kreacher. “dobby has not slept for a week harry potter!” said dobby proudly swaying where he stood. hermione looked indignant. “you haven’t slept dobby but surely harry you didn’t tell him not to — ” “no of course i didn’t,” said harry quickly. “dobby you can sleep all right but has either of you found out anything?” he hastened to ask before hermione could intervene again. “master malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,” croaked kreacher at once. “his features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of — ” “draco malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked dobby angrily. “a bad boy who — who — ” he shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire as though about to dive into it harry to whom this was not entirely unexpected caught him around the middle and held him fast. for a few seconds dobby struggled then went limp. “thank you harry potter,” he panted. “dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters. ...” harry released him dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to kreacher “but kreacher should know that draco malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf!” “yeah we don’t need to hear about you being in love with malfoy,” harry told kreacher. “let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.” kreacher bowed again looking furious and then said “master malfoy eats in the great hall he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons he attends his classes in a variety of — ” “dobby you tell me,” said harry cutting across kreacher. “has he been going anywhere he shouldn’t have?” “harry potter sir,” squeaked dobby his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight “the malfoy boy is breaking no rules that dobby can discover but he is still keen to avoid detection. he has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students who keep watch for him while he enters — ” “the room of requirement!” said harry smacking himself hard on the forehead with advanced potion making. hermione and ron stared at him. “that’s where he’s been sneaking off to! that’s where he’s doing ... whatever he’s doing! and i bet that’s why he’s been disappearing off the map — come to think of it i’ve never seen the room of requirement on there!” “maybe the marauders never knew the room was there,” said ron. “i think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said hermione. “if you need it to be unplottable it will be.” “dobby have you managed to get in to have a look at what malfoy’s doing?” said harry eagerly. “no harry potter that is impossible,” said dobby. “no it’s not,” said harry at once. “malfoy got into our headquarters there last year so i’ll be able to get in and spy on him no problem.” “but i don’t think you will harry,” said hermione slowly. “malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room didn’t he because that stupid marietta had blabbed. he needed the room to become the headquarters of the d.a. so it did. but you don’t know what the room becomes when malfoy goes in there so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into.” “there’ll be a way around that,” said harry dismissively. “you’ve done brilliantly dobby.” “kreacher’s done well too,” said hermione kindly but far from looking grateful kreacher averted his huge bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling “the mudblood is speaking to kreacher kreacher will pretend he cannot hear — ” “get out of it,” harry snapped at him and kreacher made one last deep bow and disapparated. “you’d better go and get some sleep too dobby.” “thank you harry potter sir!” squeaked dobby happily and he too vanished. “how good’s this?” said harry enthusiastically turning to ron and hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. “we know where malfoy’s going! we’ve got him cornered now!” “yeah it’s great,” said ron glumly who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay. hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand. “but what’s all this about him going up there with a variety of students’?” said hermione. “how many people are in on it you wouldn’t think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing. ...” “yeah that is weird,” said harry frowning. “i heard him telling crabbe it wasn’t crabbe’s business what he was doing ... so what’s he telling all these ... all these ...” harry’s voice tailed away he was staring at the fire. “god i’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “it’s obvious isn’t it there was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. ... he could’ve nicked some any time during that lesson. ...” “nicked what?” said ron. “polyjuice potion. he stole some of the polyjuice potion slughorn showed us in our first potions lesson. ... there aren’t a whole variety of students standing guard for malfoy ... it’s just crabbe and goyle as usual. ... yeah it all fits!” said harry jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. “they’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them what he’s up to ... but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around outside the room of requirement so he’s got them taking polyjuice to make them look like other people. ... those two girls i saw him with when he missed quidditch — ha! crabbe and goyle!” “do you mean to say,” said hermione in a hushed voice “that that little girl whose scales i repaired — ” “yeah of course!” said harry loudly staring at her. “of course! malfoy must’ve been inside the room at the time so she — what am i talking about — he dropped the scales to tell malfoy not to come out because there was someone there! and there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! we’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!” “he’s got crabbe and goyle transforming into girls?” guffawed ron. “blimey ... no wonder they don’t look too happy these days. ... i’m surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it. ...” “well they wouldn’t would they if he’s shown them his dark mark?” said harry. “hmmm ... the dark mark we don’t know exists,” said hermione skeptically rolling up ron’s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him. “well see,” said harry confidently. “yes we will,” hermione said getting to her feet and stretching. “but harry before you get all excited i still don’t think you’ll be able to get into the room of requirement without knowing what’s there first. and i don’t think you should forget” — she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look — “that what you’re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from slughorn. good night.” harry watched her go feeling slightly disgruntled. once the door to the girls’ dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on ron. “what d’you think?” “wish i could disapparate like a house-elf,” said ron staring at the spot where dobby had vanished. “i’d have that apparition test in the bag.” harry did not sleep well that night. he lay awake for what felt like hours wondering how malfoy was using the room of requirement and what he harry would see when he went in there the following day for whatever hermione said harry was sure that if malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the d.a. he would be able to see malfoy ’s ... what could it be a meeting place a hideout a storeroom a workshop harry’s mind worked feverishly and his dreams when he finally fell asleep were broken and disturbed by images of malfoy who turned into slughorn who turned into snape. ... harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning he had a free period before defense against the dark arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the room of requirement. hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room which irritated harry because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to. “look,” he said quietly leaning forward and putting a hand on the daily prophet which she had just removed from a post owl to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. “i haven’t forgotten about slughorn but i haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him and until i get a brain wave why shouldn’t i find out what malfoy’s doing?” “i’ve already told you you need to persuade slughorn,” said hermione. “it’s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him or dumbledore could have done it in a second. instead of messing around outside the room of requirement” — she jerked the prophet out from under harry’s hand and unfolded it to look at the front page — “you should go and find slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.” “anyone we know — ” asked ron as hermione scanned the headlines. “yes!” said hermione causing both harry and ron to gag on their breakfast. “but it’s all right he’s not dead — it’s mundungus he’s been arrested and sent to azkaban! something to do with impersonating an inferius during an attempted burglary . . . and someone called octavius pepper has vanished. ... oh and how horrible a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents they think he was under the imperius curse. ...” they finished their breakfast in silence. hermione set off immediately for ancient runes ron for the common room where he still had to finish his conclusion on snape’s dementor essay and harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of barnabas the barmy teaching trolls to do ballet. harry slipped on his invisibility cloak once he had found an empty passage but he need not have bothered. when he reached his destination he found it deserted. harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with malfoy inside it or out but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of crabbe or goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl. he closed his eyes as he approached the place where the room of requirement’s door was concealed. he knew what he had to do he had become most accomplished at it last year. concentrating with all his might he thought i need to see what malfoy ’s doing in here. ... i need to see what malfoy’s doing in here. ... i need to see what malfoy’s doing in here. ... three times he walked past the door then his heart pounding with excitement he opened his eyes and faced it — but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. he moved forward and gave it an experimental push. the stone remained solid and unyielding. “okay,” said harry aloud. “okay ... i thought the wrong thing. ...” he pondered for a moment then set off again eyes closed concentrating as hard as he could. i need to see the place where malfoy keeps coming secretly. ... i need to see the place where malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . . after three walks past he opened his eyes expectantly. there was no door. “oh come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “that was a clear instruction. ... fine ...” he thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. i need you to become the place you become for draco malfoy. ... he did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling he was listening hard as though he might hear the door pop into existence. he heard nothing however except the distant twittering of birds outside. he opened his eyes. there was still no door. harry swore. someone screamed. he looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost. harry tried every variation of “i need to see what draco malfoy is doing inside you” that he could think of for a whole hour at the end of which he was forced to concede that hermione might have had a point the room simply did not want to open for him. frustrated and annoyed he set off for defense against the dark arts pulling off his invisibility cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went. “late again potter,” said snape coldly as harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. “ten points from gryffindor.” harry scowled at snape as he flung himself into the seat beside ron half the class was still on its feet taking out books and organizing their things he could not be much later than any of them. “before we start i want your dementor essays,” said snape waving his wand carelessly so that twenty five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. “and i hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe i had to endure on resisting the imperius curse. now if you will all open your books to page — what is it mr. finnigan?” “sir,” said seamus “i’ve been wondering how do you tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost because there was something in the paper about an inferius — ” “no there wasn’t,” said snape in a bored voice. “but sir i heard people talking — ” “if you had actually read the article in question mr. finnigan you would have known that the so-called inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of mundungus fletcher.” “i thought snape and mundungus were on the same side,” muttered harry to ron and hermione. “shouldn’t he be upset mundungus has been arrest “but potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said snape pointing suddenly at the back of the room his black eyes fixed on harry “let us ask potter how we would tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost.” the whole class looked around at harry who hastily tried to recall what dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit slughorn. “er — well — ghosts are transparent — ” he said. “oh very good,” interrupted snape his lip curling. “yes it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you potter. ‘ghosts are transparent.’ ” pansy parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. several other people were smirking. harry took a deep breath and continued calmly though his insides were boiling “yeah ghosts are transparent but inferi are dead bodies aren’t they so they’d be solid — ” “a five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered snape. “the inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a dark wizard’s spells. it is not alive it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s bidding. a ghost as i trust that you are all aware by now is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth ... and of course as potter so wisely tells us transparent.” “well what harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them apart!” said ron. “when we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid aren’t we we’re not going to be asking ‘excuse me are you the imprint of a departed soul?’ ” there was a ripple of laughter instantly quelled by the look snape gave the class. “another ten points from gryffindor,” said snape. “i would expect nothing more sophisticated from you ronald weasley the boy so solid he cannot apparate half an inch across a room.” “ivo!” whispered hermione grabbing harry’s arm as he opened his mouth furiously. “there’s no point you’ll just end up in detention again leave it!” “now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said snape smirking a little “and read the first two paragraphs on the cruciatus curse. ...” ron was very subdued all through the class. when the bell sounded at the end of the lesson lavender caught up with ron and harry hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached and abused snape hotly for his jibe about ron’s apparition but this seemed to merely irritate ron and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with harry. “snape’s right though isn’t he?” said ron after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. “i dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test. i just can’t get the hang of apparition.” “you might as well do the extra practice sessions in hogsmeade and see where they get you,” said harry reasonably. “it’ll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. then if you’re still not — you know — as good as you’d like to be you can postpone the test do it with me over the summ — myrtle this is the boys’ bathroom!” the ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair staring at them through thick white round glasses. “oh,” she said glumly. “it’s you two.” “who were you expecting?” said ron looking at her in the mirror. “nobody,” said myrtle picking moodily at a spot on her chin. “he said he’d come back and see me but then you said you’d pop in and visit me too” — she gave harry a reproachful look — “and i haven’t seen you for months and months. i’ve learned not to expect too much from boys.” “i thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said harry who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now. “i do,” she said with a sulky little shrug “but that doesn’t mean i can’t visit other places. i came and saw you in your bath once remember?” “vividly,” said harry. “but i thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. “maybe if you two left he’d come back again. ... we had lots in common. ... i’m sure he felt it. ...” and she looked hopefully toward the door. “when you say you had lots in common,” said ron sounding rather amused now “d’you mean he lives in an s-bend too?” “no,” said myrtle defiantly her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. “i mean he’s sensitive people bully him too and he feels lonely and hasn’t got anybody to talk to and he’s not afraid to show his feelings and cry!” “there’s been a boy in here crying?” said harry curiously. “a young boy?” “never you mind!” said myrtle her small leaky eyes fixed on ron who was now definitely grinning. “i promised i wouldn’t tell anyone and i’ll take his secret to the — ” “ — not the grave surely?” said ron with a snort. “the sewers maybe ...” myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. goading myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into ron. “you’re right,” he said swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder “i’ll do the practice sessions in hogsmeade before i decide about taking the test.” and so the following weekend ron joined hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village he missed making trips there and it was a particularly fine spring day one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. however he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the room of requirement. “you’d do better,” said hermione when he confided this plan to ron and her in the entrance hall “to go straight to slughorn’s office and try and get that memory from him.” “i’ve been trying!” said harry crossly which was perfectly true. he had lagged behind after every potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner slughorn but the potions master always left the dungeon so fast that harry had not been able to catch him. twice harry had gone to his office and knocked but received no reply though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone. “he doesn’t want to talk to me hermione! he can tell i’ve been trying to get him on his own again and he’s not going to let it happen!” “well you’ve just got to keep at it haven’t you?” the short queue of people waiting to file past filch who was doing his usual prodding act with the secrecy sensor moved forward a few steps and harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. he wished ron and hermione both luck then turned and climbed the marble staircase again determined whatever hermione said to devote an hour or two to the room of requirement. once out of sight of the entrance hall harry pulled the marauder’s map and his invisibility cloak from his bag. having concealed himself he tapped the map murmured “ i solemnly swear that i am up to no good,” and scanned it carefully. as it was sunday morning nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms the gryffindors in one tower the ravenclaws in another the slytherins in the dungeons and the hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. . . . there were a few people out in the grounds ... and there alone in the seventh-floor corridor was gregory goyle. there was no sign of the room of requirement but harry was not worried about that if goyle was standing guard outside it the room was open whether the map was aware of it or not. he therefore sprinted up the stairs slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor when he began to creep very slowly toward the very same little girl clutching her heavy brass scales that hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. he waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering “hello ... you’re very pretty aren’t you?” goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror threw the scales up into the air and sprinted away vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. laughing harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which he was sure draco malfoy was now standing frozen aware that someone unwelcome was out there but not daring to make an appearance. it gave harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried. yet this hopeful mood did not last long. half an hour later having tried many more variations of his request to see what malfoy was up to the wall was just as doorless as ever. harry felt frustrated beyond belief malfoy might be just feet away from him and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. losing his patience completely harry ran at the wall and kicked it. “ouch!” he thought he might have broken his toe as he clutched it and hopped on one foot the invisibility cloak slipped off him. “harry?” he spun around one-legged and toppled over. there to his utter astonishment was tonks walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor. “what’re you doing here?” he said scrambling to his feet again why did she always have to find him lying on the floor “i came to see dumbledore,” said tonks. harry thought she looked terrible thinner than usual her mouse-colored hair lank. “his office isn’t here,” said harry “it’s round the other side of the castle behind the gargoyle — ” “i know,” said tonks. “he’s not there. apparently he’s gone away again.” “has he?” said harry putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. “hey — you don’t know where he goes i suppose?” “no,” said tonks. “what did you want to see him about?” “nothing in particular,” said tonks picking apparently unconsciously at the sleeve of her robe. “i just thought he might know what’s going on. ... i’ve heard rumors ... people getting hurt ...” “yeah i know it’s all been in the papers,” said harry. “that little kid trying to kill his — ” “the prophet’s often behind the times,” said tonks who didn’t seem to be listening to him. “you haven’t had any letters from anyone in the order recently?” “no one from the order writes to me anymore,” said harry “not since sirius — ” he saw that her eyes had filled with tears. “i’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “i mean ... i miss him as well. ...” “what?” said tonks blankly as though she had not heard him. “well ... i’ll see you around harry ...” and she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor leaving harry to stare after her. after a minute or so he pulled the invisibility cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the room of requirement but his heart was not in it. finally a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that ron and hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to malfoy who hopefully would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come. he found ron and hermione in the great hall already halfway through an early lunch. “i did it — well kind of!” ron told harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. “i was supposed to be apparating to outside madam puddifoot’s tea shop and i overshot it a bit ended up near scrivenshaft’s but at least i moved!” “good one,” said harry. “how’d you do hermione?” “oh she was perfect obviously,” said ron before hermione could answer. “perfect deliberation divination and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the three broomsticks after and you should’ve heard twycross going on about her — i’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon — ” “and what about you?” asked hermione ignoring ron. “have you been up at the room of requirement all this time?” “yep,” said harry. “and guess who i ran into up there tonks!” “tonks?” repeated ron and hermione together looking surprised. “yeah she said she’d come to visit dumbledore. ...” “if you ask me,” said ron once harry had finished describing his conversation with tonks “she’s cracking up a bit. losing her nerve after what happened at the ministry.” “it’s a bit odd,” said hermione who for some reason looked very concerned. “she’s supposed to be guarding the school why’s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see dumbledore when he’s not even here?” “i had a thought,” said harry tentatively. he felt strange about voicing it this was much more hermione’s territory than his. “you don’t think she can have been . . . you know ... in love with sirius?” hermione stared at him. “what on earth makes you say that?” “i dunno,” said harry shrugging “but she was nearly crying when i mentioned his name . . . and her patronus is a big four-legged thing now. ... i wondered whether it hadn’t become ... you know ... him.” “it’s a thought,” said hermione slowly. “but i still don’t know why she’d be bursting into the castle to see dumbledore if that’s really why she was here. ...” “goes back to what i said doesn’t it?” said ron who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. “she’s gone a bit funny. lost her nerve. women,” he said wisely to harry “they’re easily upset.” “and yet,” said hermione coming out of her reverie “i doubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because madam rosmerta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag the healer and the mimbulus mimbletonia.” ron scowled. after the burial patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets but these signs of approaching summer did not lift harry’s mood. he had been thwarted both in his attempts to find out what malfoy was doing and in his efforts to start a conversation with slughorn that might lead somehow to slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades. “for the last time just forget about malfoy,” hermione told harry firmly. they were sitting with ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. hermione and ron were both clutching a ministry of magic leaflet — common apparition mistakes and how to avoid them — for they were taking their tests that very afternoon but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves. ron gave a start and tried to hide behind hermione as a girl came around the corner. “it isn’t lavender,” said hermione wearily. “oh good,” said ron relaxing. “harry potter?” said the girl. “i was asked to give you this.” “thanks ...” harry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. once the girl was out of earshot he said “dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until i got the memory!” “maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” suggested hermione as harry unrolled the parchment but rather than finding dumbledore ’s long narrow slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run. dear harry ron and hermione aragog died last night harry and ron you met him and you know how special he was. hermione i know you’d have liked him. it would mean a lot to me if you’d nip down for the burial later this evening. i’m planning on doing it round dusk that was his favorite time of day. i know you’re not supposed to be out that late but you can use the cloak. wouldn’t ask but i can’t face it alone. hagrid “look at this,” said harry handing the note to hermione. “oh for heaven’s sake,” she said scanning it quickly and passing it to ron who read it through looking increasingly incredulous. “he’s mentaft” he said furiously. “that thing told its mates to eat harry and me! told them to help themselves! and now hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!” “it’s not just that,” said hermione. “he’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught.” “we’ve been down to see him by night before,” said harry. “yes but for something like this?” said hermione. “we’ve risked a lot to help hagrid out but after all — aragog’s dead. if it were a question of saving him — ” “ — i’d want to go even less,” said ron firmly. “you didn’t meet him hermione. believe me being dead will have improved him a lot.” harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it. tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment. ... “harry you can’t be thinking of going,” said hermione. “it’s such a pointless thing to get detention for.” harry sighed. “yeah i know,” he said. “i s’pose hagrid ’ll have to bury aragog without us.” “yes he will,” said hermione looking relieved. “look potions will be almost empty this afternoon with us all off doing our tests. ... try and soften slughorn up a bit then!” “fifty-seventh time lucky you think?” said harry bitterly. “lucky,” said ron suddenly. “harry that’s it — get lucky!” “what d’you mean?” “use your lucky potion!” “ron that’s — that’s it!” said hermione sounding stunned. “of course! why didn’t i think of it?” harry stared at them both. “felix felicis?” he said. “i dunno ... i was sort of saving it. ...” “what for?” demanded ron incredulously. “what on earth is more important than this memory harry?” asked hermione. harry did not answer. the thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time vague and unformulated plans that involved ginny splitting up with dean and ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend had been fermenting in the depths of his brain unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . . “harry are you still with us?” asked hermione. “wha —  yeah of course,” he said pulling himself together. “well ... okay. if i can’t get slughorn to talk this afternoon i’ll take some felix and have another go this evening.” “that’s decided then,” said hermione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. “destination ... determination ... deliberation ...” she murmured. “oh stop that,” ron begged her “i feel sick enough as it is — quick hide me!” “it isn’t lavender!” said hermione impatiently as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and ron dived behind her. “cool,” said ron peering over hermione’s shoulder to check. “blimey they don’t look happy do they?” “they’re the montgomery sisters and of course they don’t look happy didn’t you hear what happened to their little brother?” said hermione. “i’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives to be honest,” said ron. “well their brother was attacked by a werewolf. the rumor is that their mother refused to help the death eaters. anyway the boy was only five and he died in st. mungo’s they couldn’t save him.” “he died?” repeated harry shocked. “but surely werewolves don’t kill they just turn you into one of them?” “they sometimes kill,” said ron who looked unusually grave now. “i’ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.” “what was the werewolf’s name?” said harry quickly. “well the rumor is that it was that fenrir greyback,” said hermione. “i knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids the one lupin told me about!” said harry angrily. hermione looked at him bleakly. “harry you’ve got to get that memory,” she said. “it’s all about stopping voldemort isn’t it these dreadful things that are happening are all down to him. ...” the bell rang overhead in the castle and both hermione and ron jumped to their feet looking terrified. “you’ll do fine,” harry told them both as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their apparition test. “good luck.” “and you too!” said hermione with a significant look as harry headed off to the dungeons. there were only three of them in potions that afternoon harry ernie and draco malfoy. “all too young to apparate just yet?” said slughorn genially. “not turned seventeen yet?” they shook their heads. “ah well,” said slughorn cheerily “as we’re so few we’ll do something fun. i want you all to brew me up something amusing!” “that sounds good sir,” said ernie sycophantically rubbing his hands together. malfoy on the other hand did not crack a smile. “what do you mean ‘something amusing?” he said irritably. “oh surprise me,” said slughorn airily. malfoy opened his copy of advanced potion-making with a sulky expression. it could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time. undoubtedly harry thought watching him over the top of his own book malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the room of requirement. was it his imagination or did malfoy like tonks look thinner certainly he looked paler his skin still had that grayish tinge probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. but there was no air of smugness excitement or superiority none of the swagger that he had had on the hogwarts express when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by voldemort. ... there could be only one conclusion in harry’s opinion the mission whatever it was was going badly. cheered by this thought harry skimmed through his copy of advanced potion-making and found a heavily corrected half-blood prince’s version of “an elixir to induce euphoria,” which seemed not only to meet slughorn ’s instructions but which might harry’s heart leapt as the thought struck him put slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if harry could persuade him to taste some. ... “well now this looks absolutely wonderful,” said slughorn an hour and a half later clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of harry’s cauldron. “euphoria i take it and what’s that i smell mmmm ... you’ve added just a sprig of peppermint haven’t you unorthodox but what a stroke of inspiration harry of course that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. ... i really don’t know where you get these brain waves my boy . . . unless — ” harry pushed the half-blood prince’s book deeper into his bag with his foot. “ — it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you!” “oh ... yeah maybe,” said harry relieved. ernie was looking rather grumpy determined to outshine harry for once he had most rashly invented his own potion which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. malfoy was already packing up sour-faced slughorn had pronounced his hiccuping solution merely “passable.” the bell rang and both ernie and malfoy left at once. “sir,” harry began but slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and harry he hurried away as fast as he could. “professor — professor don’t you want to taste my po — ” called harry desperately. but slughorn had gone. disappointed harry emptied the cauldron packed up his things left the dungeon and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room. ron and hermione returned in the late afternoon. “harry!” cried hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. “harry i passed!” “well done!” he said. “and ron?” “he — he just failed,” whispered hermione as ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. “it was really unlucky a tiny thing the examiner just spotted that he’d left half an eyebrow behind. ... how did it go with slughorn?” “no joy,” said harry as ron joined them. “bad luck mate but you’ll pass next time — we can take it together.” “yeah i s’pose,” said ron grumpily. “but half an eyebrow like that matters!” “i know,” said hermione soothingly “it does seem really harsh. ...” they spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the apparition examiner and ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room now discussing the continuing problem of slughorn and the memory. “so harry — you going to use the felix felicis or what?” ron demanded. “yeah i s’pose i’d better,” said harry. “i don’t reckon i’ll need all of it not twelve hours’ worth it can’t take all night. ... i’ll just take a mouthful. two or three hours should do it.” “it’s a great feeling when you take it,” said ron reminiscently. “like you can’t do anything wrong.” “what are you talking about?” said hermione laughing. “you’ve never taken any!” “yeah but i thought i had didn’t i?” said ron as though explaining the obvious. “same difference really ...” as they had only just seen slughorn enter the great hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals they lingered for a while in the common room the plan being that harry should go to slughorn ’s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. when the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the forbidden forest they decided the moment had come and after checking carefully that neville dean and seamus were all in the common room sneaked up to the boys’ dormitory. harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny gleaming bottle. “well here goes,” said harry and he raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp. “what does it feel like?” whispered hermione. harry did not answer for a moment. then slowly but surely an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him he felt as though he could have done anything anything at all ... and getting the memory from slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible but positively easy. ... he got to his feet smiling brimming with confidence. “excellent,” he said. “really excellent. right ... i’m going down to hagrid’s.” “what?” said ron and hermione together looking aghast. “no harry — you’ve got to go and see slughorn remember?” said hermione. “no,” said harry confidently. “i’m going to hagrid’s i’ve got a good feeling about going to hagrid’s.” “you’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked ron looking stunned. “yeah,” said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag. “i feel like it’s the place to be tonight you know what i mean?” “no,” said ron and hermione together both looking positively alarmed now. “this is felix felicis i suppose?” said hermione anxiously holding up the bottle to the light. “you haven’t got another little bottle full of — i don’t know “essence of insanity?” suggested ron as harry swung his cloak over his shoulders. harry laughed and ron and hermione looked even more alarmed. “trust me,” he said. “i know what i’m doing ... or at least” — he strolled confidently to the door — “felix does.” he pulled the invisibility cloak over his head and set off down the stairs ron and hermione hurrying along behind him. at the foot of the stairs harry slid through the open door. “what were you doing up there with her?” shrieked lavender brown staring right through harry at ron and hermione emerging together from the boys’ dormitories. harry heard ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them. getting through the portrait hole was simple as he approached it ginny and dean came through it and harry was able to slip between them. as he did so he brushed accidentally against ginny. “don’t push me please dean,” she said sounding annoyed. “you’re always doing that i can get through perfectly well on my own. ...” the portrait swung closed behind harry but not before he had heard dean make an angry retort. ... his feeling of elation increasing harry strode off through the castle. he did not have to creep along for he met nobody on his way but this did not surprise him in the slightest this evening he was the luckiest person at hogwarts. why he knew that going to hagrid’s was the right thing to do he had no idea. it was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time he could not see the final destination he could not see where slughorn came in but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. when he reached the entrance hall he saw that filch had forgotten to lock the front door. beaming harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk. it was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to hagrid’s. it was not strictly on the way but it seemed clear to harry that this was a whim on which he should act so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch where he was pleased but not altogether surprised to find professor slughorn in conversation with professor sprout. harry lurked behind a low stone wall feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation. “i do thank you for taking the time pomona,” slughorn was saying courteously “most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.” “oh i quite agree,” said professor sprout warmly. “that enough for you?” “plenty plenty,” said slughorn who harry saw was carrying an armful of leafy plants. “this should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. ... well good evening to you and many thanks again!” professor sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses and slughorn directed his steps to the spot where harry stood invisible. seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish. “good evening professor.” “merlin’s beard harry you made me jump,” said slughorn stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. “how did you get out of the castle?” “i think filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors,” said harry cheerfully and was delighted to see slughorn scowl. “i’ll be reporting that man he’s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. ... but why are you out here harry?” “well sir it’s hagrid,” said harry who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. “he’s pretty upset. ... but you won’t tell anyone professor i don’t want trouble for him. ...” slughorn’s curiosity was evidently aroused. “well i can’t promise that,” he said gruffly. “but i know that dumbledore trusts hagrid to the hilt so i’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful. ...” “well it’s this giant spider he’s had it for years. ... it lived in the forest. ... it could talk and everything — ” “i heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,” said slughorn softly looking over at the mass of black trees. “it’s true then?” “yes,” said harry. “but this one aragog the first one hagrid ever got it died last night. he’s devastated. he wants company while he buries it and i said i’d go.” “touching touching,” said slughorn absentmindedly his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of hagrid ’s cabin. “but acromantula venom is very valuable ... if the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. ... of course i wouldn’t want to do anything insensitive if hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any way to procure some ... i mean it’s almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it’s alive. ...” slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than harry now. ... seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get a hundred galleons a pint. ... to be frank my salary is not large. ...” and now harry saw clearly what was to be done. “well,” he said with a most convincing hesitancy “well if you wanted to come professor hagrid would probably be really pleased. ... give aragog a better send-off you know ...” “yes of course,” said slughorn his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm. “i tell you what harry i’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two. ... we’ll drink the poor beast’s — well — not health — but we’ll send it off in style anyway once it’s buried. and i’ll change my tie this one is a little exuberant for the occasion. ...” he bustled back into the castle and harry sped off to hagrid ’s delighted with himself. “yeh came,” croaked hagrid when he opened the door and saw harry emerging from the invisibility cloak in front of him. “yeah — ron and hermione couldn’t though,” said harry. “they’re really sorry.” “don’ — don’ matter ... he’d’ve bin touched yeh’re here though harry. ...” hagrid gave a great sob. he had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish and his eyes were puffy red and swollen. harry patted him consolingly on the elbow which was the highest point of hagrid he could easily reach. “where are we burying him?” he asked. “the forest?” “blimey no,” said hagrid wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt. “the other spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now aragog’s gone. turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! can yeh believe that harry?” the honest answer was “yes” harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas they had been quite clear that aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating hagrid. “never bin an area o’ the forest i couldn’ go before!” said hagrid shaking his head. “it wasn’ easy gettin’ aragog’s body out o’ there i can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead see. ... but i wanted ter give ’im a nice burial ... a proper send-off ...” he broke into sobs again and harry resumed the patting of his elbow saying as he did so for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do “professor slughorn met me coming down here hagrid.” “not in trouble are yeh?” said hagrid looking up alarmed. “yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin’ i know it it’s my fault — ” “no no when he heard what i was doing he said he’d like to come and pay his last respects to aragog too,” said harry. “he’s gone to change into something more suitable i think ... and he said he’d bring some bottles so we can drink to aragog’s memory. . . . “did he?” said hagrid looking both astonished and touched. “tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him that is an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. i’ve never really had a lot ter do with horace slughorn before. ... cornin’ ter see old aragog off though eh well ... he ’d’ve liked that aragog would. ...” harry thought privately that what aragog would have liked most about slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided but he merely moved to the rear window of hagrid ’s hut where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside its legs curled and tangled. “are we going to bury him here hagrid in your garden?” “jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch i thought,” said hagrid in a choked voice. “i’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave. jus’ thought we’d say a few nice things over him — happy memories yeh know — ” his voice quivered and broke. there was a knock on the door and he turned to answer it blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. slughorn hurried over the threshold several bottles in his arms and wearing a somber black cravat. “hagrid,” he said in a deep grave voice. “so very sorry to hear of your loss.” “tha’s very nice of yeh,” said hagrid. “thanks a lot. an’ thanks fer not givin’ harry detention neither. ...” “wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said slughorn. “sad night sad night ... where is the poor creature?” “out here,” said hagrid in a shaking voice. “shall we — shall we do it then?” the three of them stepped out into the back garden. the moon was glistening palely through the trees now and its rays mingled with the light spilling from hagrid’s window to illuminate aragog’s body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth. “magnificent,” said slughorn approaching the spider’s head where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge curved pincers shone motionless in the moonlight. harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as slughorn bent over the pincers apparently examining the enormous hairy head. “it’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said hagrid to slughorn ’s back tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “i didn’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like aragog horace.” “interested my dear hagrid i revere them,” said slughorn stepping back from the body. harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak though hagrid mopping his eyes once more noticed nothing. “now ... shall we proceed to the burial?” hagrid nodded and moved forward. he heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and with an enormous grunt rolled it into the dark pit. it hit the bottom with a rather horrible crunchy thud. hagrid started to cry again. “of course it’s difficult for you who knew him best,” said slughorn who like harry could reach no higher than hagrid’s elbow but patted it all the same. “why don’t i say a few words?” he must have got a lot of good quality venom from aragog harry thought for slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said in a slow impressive voice “farewell aragog king of arachnids whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget! though your body will decay your spirit lingers on in the quiet web-spun places of your forest home. may your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.” “tha’ was ... tha’ was ... beau’iful!” howled hagrid and he collapsed onto the compost heap crying harder than ever. “there there,” said slughorn waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell with a muffled sort of crash onto the dead spider forming a smooth mound. “let’s get inside and have a drink. get on his other side harry. ... that’s it. ... up you come hagrid ... well done ...” they deposited hagrid in a chair at the table. fang who had been skulking in his basket during the burial now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into harry’s lap as usual. slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought. “i have had it all tested for poison,” he assured harry pouring most of the first bottle into one of hagrid ’s bucket sized mugs and handing it to hagrid. “had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend rupert.” harry saw in his mind’s eye the expression on hermione’s face if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves and decided never to mention it to her. “one for harry ...” said slughorn dividing a second bottle between two mugs ... and one for me. well” — he raised his mug high — “to aragog.” “aragog,” said harry and hagrid together. both slughorn and hagrid drank deeply. harry however with the way ahead illuminated for him by felix felicis knew that he must not drink so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him. “i had him from an egg yeh know,” said hagrid morosely. “tiny little thing he was when he hatched. bout the size of a pekingese.” “sweet,” said slughorn. “used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until ... well ...” hagrid ’s face darkened and harry knew why tom riddle had contrived to have hagrid thrown out of school blamed for opening the chamber of secrets. slughorn however did not seem to be listening he was looking up at the ceiling from which a number of brass pots hung and also a long silky skein of bright white hair. “that’s never unicorn hair hagrid?” “oh yeah,” said hagrid indifferently. “gets pulled out of their tails they catch it on branches an’ stuff in the forest yeh know ...” “but my dear chap do you know how much that’s worth?” “i use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature gets injured,” said hagrid shrugging. “it’s dead useful ... very strong see.” slughorn took another deep draught from his mug his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now looking harry knew for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak matured mead crystalized pineapple and velvet smoking jackets. he refilled hagrid’s mug and his own and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how hagrid was able to look after them all. hagrid becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and slughorn ’s flattering interest stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry. the felix felicis gave harry a little nudge at this point and he noticed that the supply of drink that slughorn had brought was running out fast. harry had not yet managed to bring off the refilling charm without saying the incantation aloud but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable indeed harry grinned to himself as unnoticed by either hagrid or slughorn now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill. after an hour or so hagrid and slughorn began making extravagant toasts to hogwarts to dumbledore to elf-made wine and to — “harry potter!” bellowed hagrid slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it. “yes indeed,” cried slughorn a little thickly “parry otter the chosen boy who — well — something of that sort,” he mumbled and drained his mug too. not long after this hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon slughorn who pocketed it with cries of “to friendship! to generosity! to ten galleons a hair!” and for a while after that hagrid and slughorn were sitting side by side arms around each other singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called odo. “aaargh the good die young,” muttered hagrid slumping low onto the table a little cross-eyed while slughorn continued to warble the refrain. “me dad was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum an’ dad harry...” great fat tears oozed out of the corners of hagrid ’s crinkled eyes again he grasped harry’s arm and shook it. “bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age i never knew ... terrible thing ... terrible thing ...” and odo the hero they bore him back home to the place that he’d known as a lad sang slughorn plaintively. they laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two which was sad. ... terrible,” hagrid grunted and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep snoring deeply. “sorry,” said slughorn with a hiccup. “can’t carry a tune to save my life.” “hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said harry quietly. “he was talking about my mum and dad dying.” “oh,” said slughorn repressing a large belch. “oh dear. yes that was — was terrible indeed. terrible ... terrible ...” he looked quite at a loss for what to say and resorted to refilling their mugs. “i don’t — don’t suppose you remember it harry?” he asked awkwardly. “no — well i was only one when they died,” said harry his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in hagrid’s heavy snores. “but i’ve found out pretty much what happened since. my dad died first. did you know that?” “i — i didn’t,” said slughorn in a hushed voice. “yeah . . . voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum,” said harry. slughorn gave a great shudder but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from harry’s face. “he told her to get out of the way,” said harry remorselessly. “he told me she needn’t have died. he only wanted me. she could have run.” “oh dear,” breathed slughorn. “she could have ... she needn’t ... that’s awful. ...” “it is isn’t it?” said harry in a voice barely more than a whisper. “but she didn’t move. dad was already dead but she didn’t want me to go too. she tried to plead with voldemort ... but he just laughed. ...” “that’s enough!” said slughorn suddenly raising a shaking hand. “really my dear boy enough ... i’m an old man ... i don’t need to hear ... i don’t want to hear “i forgot,” lied harry felix felicis leading him on. “you liked her didn’t you?” “liked her?” said slughorn his eyes brimming with tears once more. “i don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked her. ... very brave ... very funny ...it was the most horrible thing. ...” “but you won’t help her son,” said harry. “she gave me her life but you won’t give me a memory.” hagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin. harry looked steadily into slughorn ’s tear-filled eyes. the potions master seemed unable to look away. “don’t say that,” he whispered. “it isn’t a question ... if it were to help you of course ... but no purpose can be served ...” “it can,” said harry clearly. “dumbledore needs information. i need information.” he knew he was safe felix was telling him that slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning. looking slughorn straight in the eye harry leaned forward a little. “i am the chosen one. i have to kill him. i need that memory.” slughorn turned paler than ever his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat. “you are the chosen one?” “of course i am,” said harry calmly. “but then ... my dear boy ... you’re asking a great deal ... you’re asking me in fact to aid you in your attempt to destroy — ” “you don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed lily evans?” “harry harry of course i do but — ” “you’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?” slughorn said nothing he looked terrified. “be brave like my mother professor. ...” slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby. “i am not proud ...” he whispered through his fingers. “i am ashamed of what — of what that memory shows. ... i think i may have done great damage that day. ...” “you’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,” said harry. “it would be a very brave and noble thing to do.” hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. slughorn and harry stared at each other over the guttering candle. there was a long long silence but felix felicis told harry not to break it to wait. then very slowly slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. he put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small empty bottle. still looking into harry’s eyes slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it so that a long silver thread of memory came away too clinging to the wand tip. longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung silvery bright from the wand. slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled then spread swirling like gas. he corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to harry. “thank you very much professor.” “you’re a good boy,” said professor slughorn tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache. “and you’ve got her eyes. ... just don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. ...” and he too put his head on his arms gave a deep sigh and fell asleep. horcruxes harry could feel the felix felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle. the front door had remained unlocked for him but on the third floor he met peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. by the time he got up to the portrait of the fat lady and pulled off his invisibility cloak he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. “what sort of time do you call this?” “i’m really sorry — i had to go out for something important — ” “well the password changed at midnight so you’ll just have to sleep in the corridor won’t you?” “you’re joking!” said harry. “why did it have to change at midnight?” “that’s the way it is,” said the fat lady. “if you’re angry go and take it up with the headmaster he’s the one who’s tightened security.” “fantastic,” said harry bitterly looking around at the hard floor. “really brilliant. yeah i would go and take it up with dumbledore if he was here because he’s the one who wanted me to — ” “he is here,” said a voice behind harry. “professor dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.” nearly headless nick was gliding toward harry his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff. “i had it from the bloody baron who saw him arrive,” said nick. “he appeared according to the baron to be in good spirits though a little tired of course.” “where is he?” said harry his heart leaping. “oh groaning and clanking up on the astronomy tower it’s a favorite pastime of his — ” “not the bloody baron — dumbledore!” “oh — in his office,” said nick. “i believe from what the baron said that he had business to attend to before turning in — ” “yeah he has,” said harry excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling dumbledore he had secured the memory. he wheeled about and sprinted off again ignoring the fat lady who was calling after him. “come back! all right i lied! i was annoyed you woke me up! the password’s still ‘tapeworm’!” but harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes he was saying “toffee eclairs” to dumbledore’s gargoyle which leapt aside permitting harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. “enter,” said dumbledore when harry knocked. he sounded exhausted. harry pushed open the door. there was dumbledore’s office looking the same as ever but with black star strewn skies beyond the windows. “good gracious harry,” said dumbledore in surprise. “to what do i owe this very late pleasure?” “sir — i’ve got it. i’ve got the memory from slughorn.” harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to dumbledore. for a moment or two the headmaster looked stunned. then his face split in a wide smile. “harry this is spectacular news! very well done indeed! i knew you could do it!” all thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten he hurried around his desk took the bottle with slughorn’s memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the pensieve. “and now,” said dumbledore placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. “now at last we shall see. harry quickly ...” harry bowed obediently over the pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . once again he fell through darkness and landed in horace slughorn’s office many years before. there was the much younger slughorn with his thick shiny straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe a small glass of wine in one hand the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. and there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around slughorn with tom riddle in the midst of them marvolo’s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. dumbledore landed beside harry just as riddle asked “sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring?” “tom tom if i knew i couldn’t tell you,” said slughorn wagging his finger reprovingly at riddle though winking at the same time. “i must say i’d like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are.” riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. “what with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple by the way you’re quite right it is my favorite — ” several of the boys tittered again. “ — i confidently expect you to rise to minister of magic within twenty years. fifteen if you keep sending me pineapple i have excellent contacts at the ministry.” tom riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. “i don’t know that politics would suit me sir,” he said when the laughter had died away. “i don’t have the right kind of background for one thing.” a couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke undoubtedly about what they knew or suspected regarding their gang leader’s famous ancestor. “nonsense,” said slughorn briskly “couldn’t be plainer you come from decent wizarding stock abilities like yours. no you’ll go far tom i’ve never been wrong about a student yet.” the small golden clock standing upon slughorn ’s desk chimed eleven o’clock behind him and he looked around. “good gracious is it that time already you’d better get going boys or we’ll all be in trouble. lestrange i want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. same goes for you avery.” one by one the boys filed out of the room. slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. a movement behind him made him look around riddle was still standing there. “look sharp tom you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect ...” “sir i wanted to ask you something.” “ask away then m’boy ask away. ...” “sir i wondered what you know about . . . about horcruxes?” slughorn stared at him his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. “project for defense against the dark arts is it?” but harry could tell that slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. “not exactly sir,” said riddle. “i came across the term while reading and i didn’t fully understand it.” “no ... well ... you’d be hard-pushed to find a book at hogwarts that’ll give you details on horcruxes tom that’s very dark stuff very dark indeed,” said slughorn. “but you obviously know all about them sir i mean a wizard like you — sorry i mean if you can’t tell me obviously — i just knew if anyone could tell me you could — so i just thought i’d ask — ” it was very well done thought harry the hesitancy the casual tone the careful flattery none of it overdone. he harry had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. he could tell that riddle wanted the information very very much perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. “well,” said slughorn not looking at riddle but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple “well it can’t hurt to give you an overview of course. just so that you understand the term. a horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.” “i don’t quite understand how that works though sir,” said riddle. his voice was carefully controlled but harry could sense his excitement. “well you split your soul you see,” said slughorn “and hide part of it in an object outside the body. then even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed one cannot die for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. but of course existence in such a form ...” slughorn ’s face crumpled and harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before “ i was ripped from my body i was less than spirit less than the meanest ghost . . . but still i was alive.” “... few would want it tom very few. death would be preferable.” but riddle’s hunger was now apparent his expression was greedy he could no longer hide his longing. “how do you split your soul?” “well,” said slughorn uncomfortably “you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. splitting it is an act of violation it is against nature.” “but how do you do it?” “by an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. by committing murder. killing rips the soul apart. the wizard intent upon creating a horcrux would use the damage to his advantage he would encase the torn portion — ” “encase but how — ” “there is a spell do not ask me i don’t know!” said slughorn shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “do i look as though i have tried it — do i look like a killer?” “no sir of course not,” said riddle quickly. “i’m sorry ...i didn’t mean to offend ...” “not at all not at all not offended,” said slughorn gruffly. “it’s natural to feel some curiosity about these things. ... wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. ...” “yes sir,” said riddle. “what i don’t understand though — just out of curiosity — i mean would one horcrux be much use can you only split your soul once wouldn’t it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more pieces i mean for instance isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number wouldn’t seven — ” “merlin’s beard tom!” yelped slughorn. “seven! isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person and in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces ...” slughorn looked deeply troubled now he was gazing at riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before and harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. “of course,” he muttered “this is all hypothetical what we’re discussing isn’t it all academic ...” “yes sir of course,” said riddle quickly. “but all the same tom ... keep it quiet what i’ve told — that’s to say what we’ve discussed. people wouldn’t like to think we’ve been chatting about horcruxes. it’s a banned subject at hogwarts you know. ... dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it. ...” “i won’t say a word sir,” said riddle and he left but not before harry had glimpsed his face which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features but made them somehow less human. ... “thank you harry,” said dumbledore quietly. “let us go. ...”  when harry landed back on the office floor dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. harry sat too and waited for dumbledore to speak. “i have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,” said dumbledore at last. “it confirms the theory on which i have been working it tells me that i am right and also how very far there is still to go. ...” harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. a corpulent red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. “well harry,” said dumbledore “i am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. at the same age as you are now give or take a few months tom riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.” “you think he succeeded then sir?” asked harry. “he made a horcrux and that’s why he didn’t die when he attacked me he had a horcrux hidden somewhere a bit of his soul was safe?” “a bit ... or more,” said dumbledore. “you heard voldemort what he particularly wanted from horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times rip his soul repeatedly so as to store it in many separately concealed horcruxes. no book would have given him that information. as far as i know — as far i am sure as voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.” dumbledore paused for a moment marshaling his thoughts and then said “four years ago i received what i considered certain proof that voldemort had split his soul.” “where?” asked harry “how?” “you handed it to me harry,” said dumbledore. “the diary riddle’s diary the one giving instructions on how to reopen the chamber of secrets.” “i don’t understand sir,” said harry. “well although i did not see the riddle who came out of the diary what you described to me was a phenomenon i had never witnessed. a mere memory starting to act and think for itself a mere memory sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen no something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul i was almost sure of it. the diary had been a horcrux. but this raised as many questions as it answered. “what intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.” “i still don’t understand,” said harry. “well it worked as a horcrux is supposed to work — in other words the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. but there could be no doubt that riddle really wanted that diary read wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else so that slytherin’s monster would be unleashed again.” “well he didn’t want his hard work to be wasted,” said harry. “he wanted people to know he was slytherin’s heir because he couldn’t take credit at the time.” “quite correct,” said dumbledore nodding. “but don’t you see harry that if he intended the diary to be passed to or planted on some future hogwarts student he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. the point of a horcrux is as professor slughorn explained to keep part of the self hidden and safe not to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened that particular fragment of soul is no more you saw to that. “the careless way in which voldemort regarded this horcrux seemed most ominous to me. it suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more horcruxes so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. i did not wish to believe it but nothing else seemed to make sense. “then you told me two years later that on the night that voldemort returned to his body he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his death eaters.  who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ that was what you told me he said. ‘further than anybody,’ and i thought i knew what that meant though the death eaters did not. he was referring to his horcruxes horcruxes in the plural harry which i do not believe any other wizard has ever had. yet it fitted lord voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ “so he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?” said harry. “why couldn’t he make a sorcerer’s stone or steal one if he was so interested in immortality?” “well we know that he tried to do just that five years ago,” said dumbledore. “but there are several reasons why i think a sorcerer’s stone would appeal less than horcruxes to lord voldemort. “while the elixir of life does indeed extend life it must be drunk regularly for all eternity if the drinker is to maintain their immortality. therefore voldemort would be entirely dependent on the elixir and if it ran out or was contaminated or if the stone was stolen he would die just like any other man. voldemort likes to operate alone remember. i believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent even on the elixir intolerable. of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you but only to regain a body. thereafter i am convinced he intended to continue to rely on his horcruxes he would need nothing more if only he could regain a human form. he was already immortal you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be. “but now harry armed with this information the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us we are closer to the secret of finishing lord voldemort than anyone has ever been before. you heard him harry ‘wouldn’t it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more pieces ... isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number ...’ isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number. yes i think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to lord voldemort.” “he made seven horcruxes?” said harry horror struck while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. “but they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible — ” “i am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,” said dumbledore calmly. “but firstly no harry not seven horcruxes six. the seventh part of his soul however maimed resides inside his regenerated body. that was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile without that he has no self at all. that seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.” “but the six horcruxes then,” said harry a little desperately “how are we supposed to find them?” “you are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. and i have destroyed another.” “you have?” said harry eagerly. “yes indeed,” said dumbledore and he raised his blackened burned-looking hand. “the ring harry. marvolo’s ring. and a terrible curse there was upon it too. had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill and for professor snape’s timely action when i returned to hogwarts desperately injured i might not have lived to tell the tale. however a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of voldemort’s soul. the ring is no longer a horcrux.” “but how did you find it?” “well as you now know for many years i have made it my business to discover as much as i can about voldemort’s past life. i have traveled widely visiting those places he once knew. i stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the gaunts’ house. it seems that once voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it he did not want to wear it anymore. he hid it protected by many powerful enchantments in the shack where his ancestors had once lived morfin having been carted off to azkaban of course never guessing that i might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin or that i might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. “however we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. you destroyed the diary and i the ring but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul four horcruxes remain.” “and they could be anything?” said harry. “they could be old tin cans or i dunno empty potion bottles. ...” “you are thinking of portkeys harry which must be ordinary objects easy to overlook. but would lord voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul you are forgetting what i have showed you. lord voldemort liked to collect trophies and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. his pride his belief in his own superiority his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history these things suggest to me that voldemort would have chosen his horcruxes with some care favoring objects worthy of the honor.” “the diary wasn’t that special.” “the diary as you have said yourself was proof that he was the heir of slytherin i am sure that voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.” “so the other horcruxes?” said harry. “do you think you know what they are sir?” “i can only guess,” said dumbledore. “for the reasons i have already given i believe that lord voldemort would prefer objects that in themselves have a certain grandeur. i have therefore trawled back through voldemort’s past to see if i can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.” “the locket!” said harry loudly. “hufflepuff’s cup!” “yes,” said dumbledore smiling “i would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers that they became horcruxes three and four. the remaining two assuming again that he created a total of six are more of a problem but i will hazard a guess that having secured objects from hufflepuff and slytherin he set out to track down objects owned by gryffindor or ravenclaw. four objects from the four founders would i am sure have exerted a powerful pull over voldemort’s imagination. i cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of ravenclaw’s. i am confident however that the only known relic of gryffindor remains safe.” dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. “do you think that’s why he really wanted to come back to hogwarts sir?” said harry. “to try and find something from one of the other founders?” “my thoughts precisely,” said dumbledore. “but unfortunately that does not advance us much further for he was turned away or so i believe without the chance to search the school. i am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders’ objects. he definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.” “even if he got something of ravenclaw’s or of gryffindor’s that leaves a sixth horcrux,” said harry counting on his fingers. “unless he got both?” “i don’t think so,” said dumbledore. “i think i know what the sixth horcrux is. i wonder what you will say when i confess that i have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake nagini?” “the snake?” said harry startled. “you can use animals as horcruxes?” “well it is inadvisable to do so,” said dumbledore “because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. however if my calculations are correct voldemort was still at least one horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents’ house with the intention of killing you. “he seems to have reserved the process of making horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. you would certainly have been that. he believed that in killing you he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. he believed he was making himself invincible. i am sure that he was intending to make his final horcrux with your death. “as we know he failed. after an interval of some years however he used nagini to kill an old muggle man and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last horcrux. she underlines the slytherin connection which enhances lord voldemort’s mystique i think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything he certainly likes to keep her close and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her even for a parselmouth.” “so,” said harry “the diary’s gone the ring’s gone. the cup the locket and the snake are still intact and you think there might be a horcrux that was once ravenclaw’s or gryffindor’s?” “an admirably succinct and accurate summary yes,” said dumbledore bowing his head. “so . . . are you still looking for them sir is that where you’ve been going when you’ve been leaving the school?” “correct,” said dumbledore. “i have been looking for a very long time. i think ... perhaps ... i may be close to finding another one. there are hopeful signs.” “and if you do,” said harry quickly “can i come with you and help get rid of it?” dumbledore looked at harry very intently for a moment before saying “yes i think so.” “i can?” said harry thoroughly taken aback. “oh yes,” said dumbledore smiling slightly. “i think you have earned that right.” harry felt his heart lift. it was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. the headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by dumbledore’s decision harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and phineas nigellus actually snorted. “does voldemort know when a horcrux is destroyed sir can he feel it?” harry asked ignoring the portraits. “a very interesting question harry. i believe not. i believe that voldemort is now so immersed in evil and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long he does not feel as we do. perhaps at the point of death he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware for instance that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of lucius malfoy. when voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers i am told that his anger was terrible to behold.” “but i thought he meant lucius malfoy to smuggle it into hogwarts?” “yes he did years ago when he was sure he would be able to create more horcruxes but still lucius was supposed to wait for voldemort’s say-so and he never received it for voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. “no doubt he thought that lucius would not dare do anything with the horcrux other than guard it carefully but he was counting too much upon lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom lucius believed dead. of course lucius did not know what the diary really was. i understand that voldemort had told him the diary would cause the chamber of secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. had lucius known he held a portion of his master’s soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends by planting the diary upon arthur weasley’s daughter he hoped to discredit arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. ah poor lucius ... what with voldemort ’s fury about the fact that he threw away the horcrux for his own gain and the fiasco at the ministry last year i would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in azkaban at the moment.” harry sat in thought for a moment then asked “so if all of his horcruxes are destroyed voldemort could be killed?” “yes i think so,” said dumbledore. “without his horcruxes voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. never forget though that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair his brain and his magical powers remain intact. it will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like voldemort even without his horcruxes.” “but i haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said harry before he could stop himself. “yes you have,” said dumbledore firmly. “you have a power that voldemort has never had. you can — ” “i know!” said harry impatiently. “i can love!” it was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding “big deal!” “yes harry you can love,” said dumbledore who looked as though he knew perfectly well what harry had just refrained from saying. “which given everything that has happened to you is a great and remarkable thing. you are still too young to understand how unusual you are harry.” “so when the prophecy says that i’ll have ‘power the dark lord knows not,’ it just means — love?” asked harry feeling a little let down. “yes — just love,” said dumbledore. “but harry never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because voldemort made it so. i told you this at the end of last year. voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!” “but it comes to the same — ” “no it doesn’t!” said dumbledore sounding impatient now. pointing at harry with his black withered hand he said “you are setting too much store by the prophecy!” “but,” spluttered harry “but you said the prophecy means — ” “if voldemort had never heard of the prophecy would it have been fulfilled would it have meant anything of course not! do you think every prophecy in the hall of prophecy has been fulfilled?” “but,” said harry bewildered “but last year you said one of us would have to kill the other — ” “harry harry only because voldemort made a grave error and acted on professor trelawney’s words! if voldemort had never murdered your father would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge of course not! if he had not forced your mother to die for you would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate of course not harry! don’t you see voldemort himself created his worst enemy just as tyrants everywhere do! have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress all of them realize that one day amongst their many victims there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! voldemort is no different! always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. he heard the prophecy and he leapt into action with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!” “but — ” “it is essential that you understand this!” said dumbledore standing up and striding about the room his glittering robes swooshing in his wake harry had never seen him so agitated. “by attempting to kill you voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me and gave him the tools for the job! it is voldemort ’s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts his ambitions that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders and yet harry despite your privileged insight into voldemort’s world which incidentally is a gift any death eater would kill to have you have never been seduced by the dark arts never even for a second shown the slightest desire to become one of voldemort’s followers!” “of course i haven’t!” said harry indignantly. “he killed my mum and dad!” “you are protected in short by your ability to love!” said dumbledore loudly. “the only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like voldemort’s! in spite of all the temptation you have endured all the suffering you remain pure of heart just as pure as you were at the age of eleven when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s desire and it showed you only the way to thwart lord voldemort and not immortality or riches. harry have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with but he did not! “but he knows it now. you have flitted into lord voldemort’s mind without damage to yourself but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony as he discovered in the ministry. i do not think he understands why harry but then he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.” “but sir,” said harry making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative “it all comes to the same thing doesn’t it i’ve got to try and kill him or — ” “got to?” said dumbledore. “of course you’ve got to! but not because of the prophecy! because you yourself will never rest until you’ve tried! we both know it! imagine please just for a moment that you had never heard that prophecy! how would you feel about voldemort now think!” harry watched dumbledore striding up and down in front of him and thought. he thought of his mother his father and sirius. he thought of cedric diggory. he thought of all the terrible deeds he knew lord voldemort had done. a flame seemed to leap inside his chest searing his throat. “i’d want him finished,” said harry quietly. “and i’d want to do it.” “of course you would!” cried dumbledore. “you see the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! but the prophecy caused lord voldemort to mark you as his equal. ... in other words you are free to choose your way quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! but voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. he will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain really that — ” “that one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said harry. “yes.” but he understood at last what dumbledore had been trying to tell him. it was he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but dumbledore knew — and so do i thought harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world. sectumsempra exhausted but delighted with his night’s work harry told ron and hermione everything that had happened during next morning’s charms lesson having first cast the muffliato spell upon those nearest them). they were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of slughorn and positively awed when he told them about voldemort’s horcruxes and dumbledore’s promise to take harry along should he find another one. “wow,” said ron when harry had finally finished telling them everything ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. “wow. you’re actually going to go with dumbledore ... and try and destroy ... wow.” “ron you’re making it snow,” said hermione patiently grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which sure enough large white flakes had started to fall. lavender brown harry noticed glared at hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes and hermione immediately let go of ron’s arm. “oh yeah,” said ron looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. “sorry ... looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now. ...” he brushed some of the fake snow off hermione ’s shoulder. lavender burst into tears. ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her. “we split up,” he told harry out of the corner of his mouth. “last night. when she saw me coming out of the dormitory with hermione. obviously she couldn’t see you so she thought it had just been the two of us.” “ah,” said harry. “well — you don’t mind it’s over do you?” “no,” ron admitted. “it was pretty bad while she was yelling but at least i didn’t have to finish it.” “coward,” said hermione though she looked amused. “well it was a bad night for romance all around. ginny and dean split up too harry.” harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could he asked “how come?” “oh something really silly . . . she said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole like she couldn’t climb in herself ... but they’ve been a bit rocky for ages.” harry glanced over at dean on the other side of the classroom. he certainly looked unhappy. “of course this puts you in a bit of a dilemma doesn’t it?” said hermione. “what d’you mean?” said harry quickly. “the quidditch team,” said hermione. “if ginny and dean aren’t speaking ...” “oh — oh yeah,” said harry. “flitwick,” said ron in a warning tone. the tiny little charms master was bobbing his way toward them and hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid whereas the contents of harry’s and ron’s were still murky brown. “now now boys,” squeaked professor flitwick reproachfully. “a little less talk a little more action ... let me see you try. ...” together they raised their wands concentrating with all their might and pointed them at their flasks. harry’s vinegar turned to ice ron’s flask exploded. “yes ... for homework,” said professor flitwick reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat “practice.” they had one of their rare joint free periods after charms and walked back to the common room together. ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with lavender and hermione seemed cheery too though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said “it’s a nice day.” neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside harry’s brain she’s ron’s sister. but she’s ditched dean! she’s still ron’s sister. i’m his best mate! that’ll make it worse. if i talked to him first — he’d hit you. what if i don’t care he’s your best mate harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there until hermione cried “katie! you’re back! are you okay?” harry stared it was indeed katie bell looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends. “i’m really well!” she said happily. “they let me out of st. mungo’s on monday i had a couple of days at home with mum and dad and then came back here this morning. leanne was just telling me about mclaggen and the last match harry. ...” “yeah,” said harry “well now you’re back and ron’s fit we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing ravenclaw which means we could still be in the running for the cup. listen katie ...” he had to put the question to her at once his curiosity even drove ginny temporarily from his brain. he dropped his voice as katie’s friends started gathering up their things apparently they were late for transfiguration. ... that necklace ... can you remember who gave it to you now?” “no,” said katie shaking her head ruefully. “everyone’s been asking me but i haven’t got a clue. the last thing i remember was walking into the ladies’ in the three broomsticks.” “you definitely went into the bathroom then?” said hermione. “well i know i pushed open the door,” said katie “so i suppose whoever imperiused me was standing just behind it. after that my memory’s a blank until about two weeks ago in st. mungo’s. listen i’d better go i wouldn’t put it past mcgonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back. ...” she caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends leaving harry ron and hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them. “so it must have been a girl or a woman who gave katie the necklace,” said hermione “to be in the ladies’ bathroom.” “or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said harry. “don’t forget there was a cauldron full of polyjuice potion at hogwarts. we know some of it got stolen. ...” in his mind’s eye he watched a parade of crabbes and goyles prance past all transformed into girls. “i think i’m going to take another swig of felix,” said harry “and have a go at the room of requirement again.” “that would be a complete waste of potion,” said hermione flatly putting down the copy of spellman’s syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. “luck can only get you so far harry. the situation with slughorn was different you always had the ability to persuade him you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. luck isn’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment though. don’t go wasting the rest of that potion! you’ll need all the luck you can get if dumbledore takes you along with him ...” she dropped her voice to a whisper. “couldn’t we make some more?” ron asked harry ignoring hermione. “it’d be great to have a stock of it. ... have a look in the book ...” harry pulled his copy of advanced potion-making out of his bag and looked up felix felicis. “blimey it’s seriously complicated,” he said running an eye down the list of ingredients. “and it takes six months ... you’ve got to let it stew. ...” “typical,” said ron. harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down turning to it he saw the sectumsempra spell captioned “for enemies,” that he had marked a few weeks previously. he had still not found out what it did mainly because he did not want to test it around hermione but he was considering trying it out on mclaggen next time he came up behind him unawares. the only person who was not particularly pleased to see katie bell back at school was dean thomas because he would no longer be required to fill her place as chaser. he took the blow stoically enough when harry told him merely grunting and shrugging but harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that dean and seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back. the following fortnight saw the best quidditch practices harry had known as captain. his team was so pleased to be rid of mclaggen so glad to have katie back at last that they were flying extremely well. ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with dean on the contrary she was the life and soul of the team. her imitations of ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the quaffle sped toward him or of harry bellowing orders at mclaggen before being knocked out cold kept them all highly amused. harry laughing with the others was glad to have an innocent reason to look at ginny he had received several more bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the snitch. the battle still raged inside his head ginny or ron sometimes he thought that the post-lavender ron might not mind too much if he asked ginny out but then he remembered ron’s expression when he had seen her kissing dean and was sure that ron would consider it base treachery if harry so much as held her hand. ... yet harry could not help himself talking to ginny laughing with her walking back from practice with her however much his conscience ached he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. it would have been ideal if slughorn had given another of his little parties for ron would not be around — but unfortunately slughorn seemed to have given them up. once or twice harry considered asking for hermione’s help but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face he thought he caught it sometimes when hermione spotted him staring at ginny or laughing at her jokes. and to complicate matters he had the nagging worry that if he didn’t do it somebody else was sure to ask ginny out soon he and ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. all in all the temptation to take another gulp of felix felicis was becoming stronger by the day for surely this was a case for as hermione put it “tweaking the circumstances” the balmy days slid gently through may and ron seemed to be there at harry’s shoulder every time he saw ginny. harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. there seemed no chance of either while the final quidditch game of the season was looming ron wanted to talk tactics with harry all the time and had little thought for anything else. ron was not unique in this respect interest in the gryffindor-ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school for the match would decide the championship which was still wide open. if gryffindor beat ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points a tall order and yet harry had never known his team to fly better then they would win the championship. if they won by less than three hundred points they would come second to ravenclaw if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred they would be in fourth place and nobody harry thought would ever ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries. the run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features members of rival houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. somehow the game had become inextricably linked in harry’s mind with success or failure in his plans for ginny. he could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of felix felicis. in the midst of all his preoccupations harry had not forgotten his other ambition finding out what malfoy was up to in the room of requirement. he was still checking the marauder’s map and as he was unable to locate malfoy on it deduced that malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. although harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the room of requirement he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity but no matter how he reworded his request the wall remained firmly doorless. a few days before the match against ravenclaw harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again and hermione having dashed off to see professor vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last arithmancy essay. more out of habit than anything harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor checking the marauder’s map as he went. for a moment he could not find malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the room of requirement again but then he saw malfoy’s tiny labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the floor below accompanied not by crabbe or goyle but by moaning myrtle. harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. the loud crash brought him out of his reverie hurrying from the scene lest filch turn up he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. outside the bathroom he pressed his ear against the door. he could not hear anything. he very quietly pushed the door open. draco malfoy was standing with his back to the door his hands clutching either side of the sink his white blond head bowed. “don’t,” crooned moaning myrtle’s voice from one of the cubicles. “don’t ... tell me what’s wrong ... i can help you. ...” “no one can help me,” said malfoy. his whole body was shaking. “i can’t do it. ... i can’t. ... it won’t work ... and unless i do it soon ... he says he’ll kill me. ...” and harry realized with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot that malfoy was crying — actually crying — tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. malfoy gasped and gulped and then with a great shudder looked up into the cracked mirror and saw harry staring at him over his shoulder. malfoy wheeled around drawing his wand. instinctively harry pulled out his own. malfoy’s hex missed harry by inches shattering the lamp on the wall beside him harry threw himself sideways thought levicorpus and flicked his wand but malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another — “no! no! stop it!” squealed moaning myrtle her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. “stop! stop!” there was a loud bang and the bin behind harry exploded harry attempted a leg-locker curse that backfired off the wall behind malfoy’s ear and smashed the cistern beneath moaning myrtle who screamed loudly water poured everywhere and harry slipped as malfoy his face contorted cried “cruci — ” “ sectumsempral” bellowed harry from the floor waving his wand wildly. blood spurted from malfoy’s face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. he staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash his wand falling from his limp right hand. “no — ” gasped harry. slipping and staggering harry got to his feet and plunged toward malfoy whose face was now shining scarlet his white hands scrabbling at his blood soaked chest. “no — i didn’t — ” harry did not know what he was saying he fell to his knees beside malfoy who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. moaning myrtle let out a deafening scream “murder! murder in the bathroom! murder!” the door banged open behind harry and he looked up terrified snape had burst into the room his face livid. pushing harry roughly aside he knelt over malfoy drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds harry’s curse had made muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. the flow of blood seemed to ease snape wiped the residue from malfoy’s face and repeated his spell. now the wounds seemed to be knitting. harry was still watching horrified by what he had done barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. moaning myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. when snape had performed his countercurse for the third time he half-lifted malfoy into a standing position. “you need the hospital wing. there may be a certain amount of scarring but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that. ... come. ...” he supported malfoy across the bathroom turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury “and you potter ... you wait here for me.” it did not occur to harry for a second to disobey. he stood up slowly shaking and looked down at the wet floor. there were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. he could not even find it in himself to tell moaning myrtle to be quiet as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment. snape returned ten minutes later. he stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him. “go,” he said to myrtle and she swooped back into her toilet at once leaving a ringing silence behind her. “i didn’t mean it to happen,” said harry at once. his voice echoed in the cold watery space. “i didn’t know what that spell did.” but snape ignored this. “apparently i underestimated you potter,” he said quietly. “who would have thought you knew such dark magic who taught you that spell?” “i — read about it somewhere.” “where?” “it was — a library book,” harry invented wildly. “i can’t remember what it was call — ” “liar,” said snape. harry’s throat went dry. he knew what snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. ... the bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes he struggled to block out all thought but try as he might the half-blood prince’s copy of advanced potion-making swam hazily to the forefront of his mind. and then he was staring at snape again in the midst of this wrecked soaked bathroom. he stared into snape’s black eyes hoping against hope that snape had not seen what he feared but — “bring me your schoolbag,” said snape softly “and all of your schoolbooks. all of them. bring them to me here. now!” there was no point arguing. harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom. once in the corridor he broke into a run toward gryffindor tower. most people were walking the other way they gaped at him drenched in water and blood but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past. he felt stunned it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage what had the prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book and what would happen when snape saw it would he tell slughorn — harry’s stomach churned — how harry had been achieving such good results in potions all year would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught harry so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend harry could not let it happen. ... he could not ... “where ve you —  why are you soaking —  is that blood?” ron was standing at the top of the stairs looking bewildered at the sight of harry. “i need your book,” harry panted. “your potions book. quick ... give it to me ...” “but what about the half-blood — ” “i’ll explain later!” ron pulled his copy of advanced potion-making out of his bag and handed it over harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room. here he seized his schoolbag ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor. he skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls closed his eyes and began to walk. i need a place to hide my book. ... i need a place to hide my book. ... i need a place to hide my book. . . . three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. when he opened his eyes there it was at last the door to the room of requirement. harry wrenched it open flung himself inside and slammed it shut. he gasped. despite his haste his panic his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. he was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls built of what harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of hogwarts inhabitants. there were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture stowed away perhaps to hide the evidence of mishandled magic or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves. there were thousands and thousands of books no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. there were winged catapults and fanged frisbees some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items there were chipped bottles of congealed potions hats jewels cloaks there were what looked like dragon eggshells corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly several rusting swords and a heavy bloodstained axe. harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. he turned right past an enormous stuffed troll ran on a short way took a left at the broken vanishing cabinet in which montague had got lost the previous year finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. he opened one of the cupboard’s creaking doors it had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died its skeleton had five legs. he stuffed the half-blood prince’s book behind the cage and slammed the door. he paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter. ... would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinctive then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go back to the door back out onto the corridor where he slammed the door behind him and it turned at once back into stone. harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below cramming ron’s copy of advanced potion making into his bag as he did so. a minute later he was back in front of snape who held out his hand wordlessly for harry’s schoolbag. harry handed it over panting a searing pain in his chest and waited. one by one snape extracted harry’s books and examined them. finally the only book left was the potions book which he looked at very carefully before speaking. “this is your copy of advanced potion-making is it potter?” “yes,” said harry still breathing hard. “you’re quite sure of that are you potter?” “yes,” said harry with a touch more defiance. “this is the copy of advanced potion-making that you purchased from flourish and blotts?” “yes,” said harry firmly. “then why,” asked snape “does it have the name ‘roonil wazlib’ written inside the front cover?” harry’s heart missed a beat. “that’s my nickname,” he said. “your nickname,” repeated snape. “yeah ... that’s what my friends call me,” said harry. “i understand what a nickname is,” said snape. the cold black eyes were boring once more into harry’s he tried not to look into them. close your mind. ... close your mind. . . . but he had never learned how to do it properly. . . . “do you know what i think potter?” said snape very quietly. “i think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every saturday until the end of term. what do you think potter?” “i — i don’t agree sir,” said harry still refusing to look into snape ’s eyes. “well we shall see how you feel after your detentions,” said snape. “ten o’clock saturday morning potter. my office.” “but sir ...” said harry looking up desperately. “quidditch ... the last match of the ...” “ten o’clock,” whispered snape with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. “poor gryffindor ... fourth place this year i fear ...” and he left the bathroom without another word leaving harry to stare into the cracked mirror feeling sicker he was sure than ron had ever felt in his life. “i won’t say ‘i told you so,’ ” said hermione an hour later in the common room. “leave it hermione,” said ron angrily. harry had never made it to dinner he had no appetite at all. he had just finished telling ron hermione and ginny what had happened not that there seemed to have been much need. the news had traveled very fast apparently moaning myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by pansy parkinson who had lost no time in vilifying harry far and wide and snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of professor mcgonagall who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly snape ’s punishment of detention every saturday until the end of term. “i told you there was something wrong with that prince person,” hermione said evidently unable to stop herself. “and i was right wasn’t i?” “no i don’t think you were,” said harry stubbornly. he was having a bad enough time without hermione lecturing him the looks on the gryffindor team’s faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on saturday had been the worst punishment of all. he could feel ginny’s eyes on him now but did not meet them he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. he had just told her that she would be playing seeker on saturday and that dean would be rejoining the team as chaser in her place. perhaps if they won ginny and dean would make up during the post-match euphoria. ... the thought went through harry like an icy knife. ... “harry,” said hermione “how can you still stick up for that book when that spell — ” “will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped harry. “the prince only copied it out! it’s not like he was advising anyone to use it! for all we know he was making a note of something that had been used against him!” “i don’t believe this,” said hermione. “you’re actually defending — ” “i’m not defending what i did!” said harry quickly. “i wish i hadn’t done it and not just because i’ve got about a dozen detentions. you know i wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that not even on malfoy but you can’t blame the prince he hadn’t written ‘try this out it’s really good’ — he was just making notes for himself wasn’t he not for anyone else. ...” “are you telling me,” said hermione “that you’re going to go back — ” “and get the book yeah i am,” said harry forcefully. “listen without the prince i’d never have won the felix felicis. i’d never have known how to save ron from poisoning i’d never have — ” “ — got a reputation for potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said hermione nastily. “give it a rest hermione!” said ginny and harry was so amazed so grateful he looked up. “by the sound of it malfoy was trying to use an unforgivable curse you should be glad harry had something good up his sleeve!” “well of course i’m glad harry wasn’t cursed!” said hermione clearly stung. “but you can’t call that sectumsempra spell good ginny look where it’s landed him! and i’d have thought seeing what this has done to your chances in the match — ” “oh don’t start acting as though you understand quidditch,” snapped ginny “you’ll only embarrass yourself.” harry and ron stared hermione and ginny who had always got on together very well were now sitting with their arms folded glaring in opposite directions. ron looked nervously at harry then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. harry however little though he knew he deserved it felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening. his lightheartedness was short-lived. there were slytherin taunts to be endured next day not to mention much anger from fellow gryffindors who were most unhappy that their captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. by saturday morning whatever he might have told hermione harry would have gladly exchanged all the felix felicis in the world to be walking down to the quidditch pitch with ron ginny and the others. it was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan. “ah potter,” said snape when harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that snape despite teaching floors above now had not vacated it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. ominously there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where harry was clearly supposed to sit they had an aura of tedious hard and pointless work about them. “mr. filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,” said snape softly. “they are the records of other hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. where the ink has grown faint or the cards have suffered damage from mice we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and making sure that they are in alphabetical order replace them in the boxes. you will not use magic.” “right professor,” said harry with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables. “i thought you could start,” said snape a malicious smile on his lips “with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. you will find some familiar names in there which should add interest to the task. here you see ...” he pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read “ ‘james potter and sirius black. apprehended using an illegal hex upon bertram aubrey. aubrey’s head twice normal size. double detention.’ ” snape sneered. “it must be such a comfort to think that though they are gone a record of their great achievements remains. ...” harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him. it was as harry had anticipated useless boring work punctuated as snape had clearly planned with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or sirius’s names usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds occasionally accompanied by those of remus lupin and peter pettigrew. and while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments he wondered what was going on outside where the match would have just started . . . ginny playing seeker against cho . . . harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. it seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock perhaps snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly he could not have been here for only half an hour ... an hour ... an hour and a half. . . . harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. snape who had not spoken at all since setting harry his task finally looked up at ten past one. “i think that will do,” he said coldly. “mark the place you have reached. you will continue at ten o’clock next saturday.” “yes sir.” harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before snape could change his mind racing back up the stone steps straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch but all was quiet. ...it was over then. ... he hesitated outside the crowded great hall then ran up the marble staircase whether gryffindor had won or lost the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room. “ quid agis?” he said tentatively to the fat lady wondering what he would find inside. her expression was unreadable as she replied “you’ll see.” and she swung forward. a roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him several hands pulled him into the room. “we won!” yelled ron bounding into sight and brandishing the silver cup at harry. “we won! four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! we won!” harry looked around there was ginny running toward him she had a hard blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. and without thinking without planning it without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching harry kissed her. after several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. the room had gone very quiet. then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. harry looked over the top of ginny’s head to see dean thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and romilda vane looking as though she might throw something. hermione was beaming but harry’s eyes sought ron. at last he found him still clutching the cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. for a fraction of a second they looked at each other then ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that harry understood to mean well — if you must. the creature in his chest roaring in triumph he grinned down at ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. a long walk in the grounds seemed indicated during which — if they had time — they might discuss the match. the seer overheard the fact that harry potter was going out with ginny weasley seemed to interest a great number of people most of them girls yet harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. after all it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of dark magic. “you’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said ginny as she sat on the common room floor leaning against harry’s legs and reading the daily prophet “three dementor attacks in a week and all romilda vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.” ron and hermione both roared with laughter. harry ignored them. “what did you tell her?” “i told her it’s a hungarian horntail,” said ginny turning a page of the newspaper idly. “much more macho.” “thanks,” said harry grinning. “and what did you tell her ron’s got?” “a pygmy puff but i didn’t say where.” ron scowled as hermione rolled around laughing. “watch it,” he said pointing warningly at harry and ginny. “just because i’ve given my permission doesn’t mean i can’t withdraw it — ” “ ‘your permission,’ ” scoffed ginny. “since when did you give me permission to do anything anyway you said yourself you’d rather it was harry than michael or dean.” “yeah i would,” said ron grudgingly. “and just as long as you don’t start snogging each other in public “you filthy hypocrite! what about you and lavender thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place?” demanded ginny. but ron’s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into june for harry and ginny’s time together was becoming increasingly restricted. ginny’s o.w.l.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to study for hours into the night. on one such evening when ginny had retired to the library and harry was sitting beside the window in the common room supposedly finishing his herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with ginny at lunchtime hermione dropped into the seat between him and ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face. “i want to talk to you harry.” “what about?” said harry suspiciously. only the previous day hermione had told him off for distracting ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations. “the so-called half-blood prince.” “oh not again,” he groaned. “will you please drop it?” he had not dared to return to the room of requirement to retrieve his book and his performance in potions was suffering accordingly though slughorn who approved of ginny had jocularly attributed this to harry being lovesick). but harry was sure that snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the prince’s book and was determined to leave it where it was while snape remained on the lookout. “i’m not dropping it,” said hermione firmly “until you’ve heard me out. now i’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing dark spells — ” “he didn’t make a hobby of it — ” “he he — who says it’s a he?” “we’ve been through this,” said harry crossly. “prince hermione princev’ “right!” said hermione red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of harry. “look at that! look at the picture!” harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph yellowed with age ron leaned over for a look too. the picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. she was not pretty she looked simultaneously cross and sullen with heavy brows and a long pallid face. underneath the photograph was the caption eileen prince captain of the hogwarts gobstones team. “so?” said harry scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions. “her name was eileen prince. prince harry.” they looked at each other and harry realized what hermione was trying to say. he burst out laughing. “no way.” “what?” “you think she was the half-blood ...  oh come on.” “well why not harry there aren’t any real princes in the wizarding world! it’s either a nickname a made up title somebody’s given themselves or it could be their actual name couldn’t it no listen! if say her father was a wizard whose surname was prince and her mother was a muggle then that would make her a “half-blood prince’!” “yeah very ingenious hermione ...” “but it would! maybe she was proud of being half a prince!” “listen hermione i can tell it’s not a girl. i can just tell.” “the truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,” said hermione angrily. “how can i have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?” said harry stung by this. “it’s the way he writes i just know the prince was a bloke i can tell. this girl hasn’t got anything to do with it. where did you get this anyway?” “the library,” said hermione predictably. “there’s a whole collection of old prophets up there. well i’m going to find out more about eileen prince if i can.” “enjoy yourself,” said harry irritably. “i will,” said hermione. “and the first place i’ll look,” she shot at him as she reached the portrait hole “is records of old potions awards!” harry scowled after her for a moment then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky. “she’s just never got over you outperforming her in potions,” said ron returning to his copy of a thousand magical herbs and fungi. “you don’t think i’m mad wanting that book back do you?” “ ’course not,” said ron robustly. “he was a genius the prince. anyway ... without his bezoar tip ...” he drew his finger significantly across his own throat. “i wouldn’t be here to discuss it would i i mean i’m not saying that spell you used on malfoy was great — ” “nor am i,” said harry quickly. “but he healed all right didn’t he back on his feet in no time.” “yeah,” said harry this was perfectly true although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same. “thanks to snape ...” “you still got detention with snape this saturday?” ron continued. “yeah and the saturday after that and the saturday after that,” sighed harry. “and he’s hinting now that if i don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term we’ll carry on next year.” he was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with ginny. indeed he had frequently wondered lately whether snape did not know this for he was keeping harry later and later every time while making pointed asides about harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered. harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of jimmy peakes who was holding out a scroll of parchment. “thanks jimmy ... hey it’s from dumbledore!” said harry excitedly unrolling the parchment and scanning it. “he wants me to go to his office as quick as i can!” they stared at each other. “blimey,” whispered ron. “you don’t reckon ... he hasn’t found ... ” “better go and see hadn’t i?” said harry jumping to his feet. he hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could passing nobody but peeves who swooped past in the opposite direction throwing bits of chalk at harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged harry’s defensive jinx. once peeves had vanished there was silence in the corridors with only fifteen minutes left until curfew most people had already returned to their common rooms. and then harry heard a scream and a crash. he stopped in his tracks listening. “how — dare — you — aaaaargh!” the noise was coming from a corridor nearby harry sprinted toward it his wand at the ready hurtled around another corner and saw professor trelawney sprawled upon the floor her head covered in one of her many shawls several sherry bottles lying beside her one broken. “professor — ” harry hurried forward and helped professor trelawney to her feet. some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. she hiccuped loudly patted her hair and pulled herself up on harry’s helping arm. “what happened professor?” “you may well ask!” she said shrilly. “i was strolling along brooding upon certain dark portents i happen to have glimpsed ...” but harry was not paying much attention. he had just noticed where they were standing there on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and on the left that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed — “professor were you trying to get into the room of requirement?” ... omens i have been vouchsafed — what?” she looked suddenly shifty. “the room of requirement,” repeated harry. “were you trying to get in there?” “i — well — i didn’t know students knew about — ” “not all of them do,” said harry. “but what happened you screamed. ... it sounded as though you were hurt. ...” “i — well,” said professor trelawney drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. “i wished to — ah — deposit certain — um — personal items in the room. ...” and she muttered something about “nasty accusations.” “right,” said harry glancing down at the sherry bottles. “but you couldn’t get in and hide them?” he found this very odd the room had opened for him after all when he had wanted to hide the half-blood prince’s book. “oh i got in all right,” said professor trelawney glaring at the wall. “but there was somebody already in there.” “somebody in —  who?” demanded harry. “who was in there?” “i have no idea,” said professor trelawney looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in harry’s voice. “i walked into the room and i heard a voice which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the room i mean.” “a voice saying what?” “i don’t know that it was saying anything,” said professor trelawney. “it was ... whooping.” “ whooping?” “gleefully,” she said nodding. harry stared at her. “was it male or female?” “i would hazard a guess at male,” said professor trelawney. “and it sounded happy?” “very happy,” said professor trelawney sniffily. “as though it was celebrating?” “most definitely.” “and then — ” “and then i called out who’s there?’ ” “you couldn’t have found out who it was without asking?” harry asked her slightly frustrated. “the inner eye,” said professor trelawney with dignity straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads “was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.” “right,” said harry hastily he had heard about professor trelawney’s inner eye all too often before. “and did the voice say who was there?” “no it did not,” she said. “everything went pitch black and the next thing i knew i was being hurled headfirst out of the room!” “and you didn’t see that coming?” said harry unable to help himself. “no i did not as i say it was pitch — ” she stopped and glared at him suspiciously. “i think you’d better tell professor dumbledore,” said harry. “he ought to know malfoy’s celebrating — i mean that someone threw you out of the room.” to his surprise professor trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion looking haughty. “the headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,” she said coldly. “i am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. if dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show — ” her bony hand closed suddenly around harry’s wrist. “again and again no matter how i lay them out — ” and she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls. “ — the lightning-struck tower,” she whispered. “calamity. disaster. coming nearer all the time ...” “right,” said harry again. “well ... i still think you should tell dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room. ...” “you think so?” professor trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment but harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure. “i’m going to see him right now,” said harry. “i’ve got a meeting with him. we could go together.” “oh well in that case,” said professor trelawney with a smile. she bent down scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue-and-white vase standing in a nearby niche. “i miss having you in my classes harry,” she said soulfully as they set off together. “you were never much of a seer ... but you were a wonderful object harry did not reply he had loathed being the object of professor trelawney’s continual predictions of doom. “i am afraid,” she went on “that the nag — i’m sorry the centaur — knows nothing of cartomancy. i asked him — one seer to another — had he not too sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe but he seemed to find me almost comical. yes comical!” her voice rose rather hysterically and harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind. “perhaps the horse has heard people say that i have not inherited my great-great-grandmother’s gift. those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for years. you know what i say to such people harry would dumbledore have let me teach at this great school put so much trust in me all these years had i not proved myself to him?” harry mumbled something indistinct. “i well remember my first interview with dumbledore,” went on professor trelawney in throaty tones. “he was deeply impressed of course deeply impressed. ... i was staying at the hog’s head which i do not advise incidentally — bedbugs dear boy — but funds were low. dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room. he questioned me. ... i must confess that at first i thought he seemed ill-disposed toward divination . . . and i remember i was starting to feel a little odd i had not eaten much that day ... but then ...” and now harry was paying attention properly for the first time for he knew what had happened then professor trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life the prophecy about him and voldemort. ... but then we were rudely interrupted by severus snape!” “what?” “yes there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with snape who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs although i’m afraid that i myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with dumbledore — you see he himself was seeking a job at the time and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! well after that you know dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job and i could not help thinking harry that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent compared to the pushing thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes — harry dear?” she looked back over her shoulder having only just realized that harry was no longer with her he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other. “harry?” she repeated uncertainly. perhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and frightened. harry was standing stock still as waves of shock crashed over him wave after wave obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long. . . . it was snape who had overheard the prophecy. it was snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to voldemort. snape and peter pettigrew together had sent voldemort hunting after lily and james and their son. ... nothing else mattered to harry just now. “harry?” said professor trelawney again. “harry — i thought we were going to see the headmaster together?” “you stay here,” said harry through numb lips. “but dear ... i was going to tell him how i was assaulted in the room of — ” “you stay here!” harry repeated angrily. she looked alarmed as he ran past her around the corner into dumbledore’s corridor where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. he did not knock upon dumbledore’s door he hammered and the calm voice answered “enter” after harry had already flung himself into the room. fawkes the phoenix looked around his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows. dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds a long black traveling cloak in his arms. “well harry i promised that you could come with me.” for a moment or two harry did not understand the conversation with trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly. “come . . . with you ... ” “only if you wish it of course.” “if i ...” and then harry remembered why he had been eager to come to dumbledore’s office in the first place. “you’ve found one you’ve found a horcrux?” “i believe so.” rage and resentment fought shock and excitement for several moments harry could not speak. “it is natural to be afraid,” said dumbledore. ‘tm not scared!” said harry at once and it was perfectly true fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. “which horcrux is it where is it?” “i am not sure which it is — though i think we can rule out the snake — but i believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here a cave i have been trying to locate for a very long time the cave in which tom riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip you remember?” “yes,” said harry. “how is it protected?” “i do not know i have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.” dumbledore hesitated then said “harry i promised you that you could come with me and i stand by that promise but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.” “i’m coming,” said harry almost before dumbledore had finished speaking. boiling with anger at snape his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. this seemed to show on harry’s face for dumbledore moved away from the window and looked more closely at harry a slight crease between his silver eyebrows. “what has happened to you?” “nothing,” lied harry promptly. “what has upset you?” “i’m not upset.” “harry you were never a good occlumens — ” the word was the spark that ignited harry’s fury. “snape!” he said very loudly and fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. “snape’s what’s happened! he told voldemort about the prophecy it was him he listened outside the door trelawney told me!” dumbledore’s expression did not change but harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. for a long moment dumbledore said nothing. “when did you find out about this?” he asked at last. “just now!” said harry who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. and then suddenly he could not stop himself. “and you let him teach here and he told voldemort to go after my mum and dad!” breathing hard as though he was fighting harry turned away from dumbledore who still had not moved a muscle and paced up and down the study rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. he wanted to rage and storm at dumbledore but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the horcrux he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting snape but he was terrified that dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger. ... “harry,” said dumbledore quietly. “please listen to me.” it was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. harry paused biting his lip and looked into dumbledore’s lined face. “professor snape made a terrible — ” “don’t tell me it was a mistake sir he was listening at the door!” “please let me finish.” dumbledore waited until harry had nodded curtly then went on. “professor snape made a terrible mistake. he was still in lord voldemort’s employ on the night he heard the first half of professor trelawney’s prophecy. naturally he hastened to tell his master what he had heard for it concerned his master most deeply. but he did not know — he had no possible way of knowing — which boy voldemort would hunt from then onward or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that professor snape knew that they were your mother and father — ” harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter. “he hated my dad like he hated sirius! haven’t you noticed professor how the people snape hates tend to end up dead?” “you have no idea of the remorse professor snape felt when he realized how lord voldemort had interpreted the prophecy harry. i believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned — ” “but he’s a very good occlumens isn’t he sir?” said harry whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. “and isn’t voldemort convinced that snape’s on his side even now professor ... how can you be sure snape’s on our side?” dumbledore did not speak for a moment he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. at last he said “i am sure. i trust severus snape completely.” harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. it did not work. “well i don’t!” he said as loudly as before. “he’s up to something with draco malfoy right now right under your nose and you still — ” “we have discussed this harry,” said dumbledore and now he sounded stern again. “i have told you my views.” “you’re leaving the school tonight and i’ll bet you haven’t even considered that snape and malfoy might decide to — ” “to what?” asked dumbledore his eyebrows raised. “what is it that you suspect them of doing precisely?” “i ... they’re up to something!” said harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it. “professor trelawney was just in the room of requirement trying to hide her sherry bottles and she heard malfoy whooping celebrating! he’s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me he’s fixed it at last and you’re about to just walk out of school without — ” “enough,” said dumbledore. he said it quite calmly and yet harry fell silent at once he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. “do you think that i have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year i have not. tonight when i leave there will again be additional protection in place. please do not suggest that i do not take the safety of my students seriously harry.” “i didn’t — ” mumbled harry a little abashed but dumbledore cut across him. “i do not wish to discuss the matter any further.” harry bit back his retort scared that he had gone too far that he had ruined his chance of accompanying dumbledore but dumbledore went on “do you wish to come with me tonight?” “yes,” said harry at once. “very well then listen.” dumbledore drew himself up to his full height. “i take you with me on one condition that you obey any command i might give you at once and without question.” “of course.” “be sure to understand me harry. i mean that you must follow even such orders as ‘run,’ ‘hide,’ or ‘go back.’ do i have your word?” “i — yes of course.” “if i tell you to hide you will do so?” “yes.” “if i tell you to flee you will obey?” “yes.” “if i tell you to leave me and save yourself you will do as i tell you “harry?” they looked at each other for a moment. “yes sir.” “very good. then i wish you to go and fetch your invisibility cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes’ time.” dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window the sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon. harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. his mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. he knew what to do. ron and hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. “what does he want?” hermione said at once. “harry are you okay?” she added anxiously. “i’m fine,” said harry shortly racing past them. he dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the marauder’s map and a pair of balled-up socks. then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room skidding to a halt where ron and hermione sat looking stunned. “i’ve got to be quick,” harry panted. “dumbledore thinks i’m getting my invisibility cloak. listen. ...” quickly he told them where he was going and why. he did not pause either for hermione ’s gasps of horror or for ron’s hasty questions they could work out the finer details for themselves later. “... so you see what this means?” harry finished at a gallop. “dumbledore won’t be here tonight so malfoy’s going to have another clear shot at whatever he’s up to. no listen to me!” he hissed angrily as both ron and hermione showed every sign of interrupting. “i know it was malfoy celebrating in the room of requirement. here — ” he shoved the marauder’s map into hermione’s hands. “you’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to watch snape too. use anyone else who you can rustle up from the d.a. hermione those contact galleons will still work right dumbledore says he’s put extra protection in the school but if snape ’s involved he’ll know what dumbledore ’s protection is and how to avoid it — but he won’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch will he?” “harry — ” began hermione her eyes huge with fear. “i haven’t got time to argue,” said harry curtly. “take this as well — ” he thrust the socks into ron’s hands. “thanks,” said ron. “er — why do i need socks?” “you need what’s wrapped in them it’s the felix felicis. share it between yourselves and ginny too. say good-bye to her for me. i’d better go dumbledore ’s waiting — ” “no!” said hermione as ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion looking awestruck. “we don’t want it you take it who knows what you’re going to be facing?” “i’ll be fine i’ll be with dumbledore,” said harry. “i want to know you lot are okay. ... don’t look like that hermione i’ll see you later. ...” and he was off hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall. dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. he turned as harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step panting hard a searing stitch in his side. “i would like you to wear your cloak please,” said dumbledore and he waited until harry had thrown it on before saying “very good. shall we go?” dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps his own traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. harry hurried alongside him under the invisibility cloak still panting and sweating rather a lot. “but what will people think when they see you leaving professor?” harry asked his mind on malfoy and snape. “that i am off into hogsmeade for a drink,” said dumbledore lightly. “i sometimes offer rosmerta my custom or else visit the hog’s head ... or i appear to. it is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true destination.” they made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. the air was full of the smells of warm grass lake water and wood smoke from hagrid’s cabin. it was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening. “professor,” said harry quietly as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view “will we be apparating?” “yes,” said dumbledore. “you can apparate now i believe?” “yes,” said harry “but i haven’t got a license.” he felt it best to be honest what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go “no matter,” said dumbledore “i can assist you again.” they turned out of the gates into the twilit deserted lane to hogsmeade. darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the high street night was falling in earnest. lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the three broomsticks they heard raucous shouting. “ — and stay out!” shouted madam rosmerta forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. “oh hello albus ... you’re out late ...” “good evening rosmerta good evening ... forgive me i’m off to the hog’s head. ... no offense but i feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight. ...” a minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the hog’s head’s sign creaked a little though there was no breeze. in contrast to the three broomsticks the pub appeared to be completely empty. “it will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered dumbledore glancing around. “as long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm harry. there is no need to grip too hard i am merely guiding you. on the count of three ... one ... two ... three ...” harry turned. at once there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube he could not draw breath every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then just when he thought he must suffocate the invisible bands seemed to burst open and he was standing in cool darkness breathing in lungfuls of fresh salty air. the cave harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves a light chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky. he was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foaming and churning below him. he glanced over his shoulder. a towering cliff stood behind them a sheer drop black and faceless. a few large chunks of rock such as the one upon which harry and dumbledore were standing looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. it was a bleak harsh view the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. “what do you think?” asked dumbledore. he might have been asking harry’s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic. “they brought the kids from the orphanage here?” asked harry who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip. “not here precisely,” said dumbledore. “there is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. i believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. no i think it was only ever tom riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. no muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers and boats cannot approach the cliffs the waters around them are too dangerous. i imagine that riddle climbed down magic would have served better than ropes. and he brought two small children with him probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. i think the journey alone would have done it don’t you?” harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps. “but his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on. come.” dumbledore beckoned harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. it was a treacherous descent and dumbledore hampered slightly by his withered hand moved slowly. the lower rocks were slippery with seawater. harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. “lumos,” said dumbledore as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. a thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. “you see?” said dumbledore quietly holding his wand a little higher. harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. “you will not object to getting a little wet?” “no,” said harry. “then take off your invisibility cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge.” and with the sudden agility of a much younger man dumbledore slid from the boulder landed in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststroke toward the dark slit in the rock face his lit wand held in his teeth. harry pulled off his cloak stuffed it into his pocket and followed. the water was icy harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed he struck out for the shimmering shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. the fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. the slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of dumbledore ’s wand. a little way in the passageway curved to the left and harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. he continued to swim in dumbledore ’s wake the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough wet rock. then he saw dumbledore rising out of the water ahead his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. when harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. he clambered up them water streaming from his soaking clothes and emerged shivering uncontrollably into the still and freezing air. dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot examining the walls and ceiling. “yes this is the place,” said dumbledore. “how can you tell?” harry spoke in a whisper. “it has known magic,” said dumbledore simply. harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments. he watched as dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot evidently concentrating on things harry could not see. “this is merely the antechamber the entrance hall,” said dumbledore after a moment or two. “we need to penetrate the inner place. ... now it is lord voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way rather than those nature made. ...” dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips murmuring words in a strange tongue that harry did not understand. twice dumbledore walked right around the cave touching as much of the rough rock as he could occasionally pausing running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot until finally he stopped his hand pressed flat against the wall. “here,” he said. “we go on through here. the entrance is concealed.” harry did not ask how dumbledore knew. he had never seen a wizard work things out like this simply by looking and touching but harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. for a moment an arched outline appeared there blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack. “you’ve d-done it!” said harry through chattering teeth but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. dumbledore looked around. “harry i’m so sorry i forgot,” he said he now pointed his wand at harry and at once harry’s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire. “thank you,” said harry gratefully but dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. he did not try any more magic but simply stood there staring at it intently as though something extremely interesting was written on it. harry stayed quite still he did not want to break dumbledore’s concentration. then after two solid minutes dumbledore said quietly “oh surely not. so crude.” “what is it professor?” “i rather think,” said dumbledore putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind harry used to chop potion ingredients “that we are required to make payment to pass.” “payment?” said harry. “you’ve got to give the door something?” “yes,” said dumbledore. “blood if i am not much mistaken.” “blood?” “i said it was crude,” said dumbledore who sounded disdainful even disappointed as though voldemort had fallen short of the standards dumbledore expected. “the idea as i am sure you will have gathered is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter. once again lord voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.” “yeah but still if you can avoid it ...” said harry who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more. “sometimes however it is unavoidable,” said dumbledore shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand. “professor!” protested harry hurrying forward as dumbledore raised his knife. “ill do it i’m — ” he did not know what he was going to say — younger fitter but dumbledore merely smiled. there was a flash of silver and a spurt of scarlet the rock face was peppered with dark glistening drops. “you are very kind harry,” said dumbledore now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm so that it healed instantly just as snape had healed malfoy’s wounds. “but your blood is worth more than mine. ah that seems to have done the trick doesn’t it?” the blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more and this time it did not fade away the blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. “after me i think,” said dumbledore and he walked through the archway with harry on his heels lighting his own wand hastily as he went. an eerie sight met their eyes they were standing on the edge of a great black lake so vast that harry could not make out the distant banks in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. a misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake it was reflected in the completely still water below. the greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness though their rays did not penetrate as far as harry would have expected. the darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness. “let us walk,” said dumbledore quietly. “be very careful not to step into the water. stay close to me.” he set off around the edge of the lake and harry followed close behind him. their footsteps made echoing slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. on and on they walked but the view did not vary on one side of them the rough cavern wall on the other the boundless expanse of smooth glassy blackness in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. harry found the place and the silence oppressive unnerving. “professor?” he said finally. “do you think the horcrux is here?” “oh yes,” said dumbledore. “yes i’m sure it is. the question is how do we get to it?” “we couldn’t ... we couldn’t just try a summoning charm?” harry said sure that it was a stupid suggestion. but he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible. “certainly we could,” said dumbledore stopping so suddenly that harry almost walked into him. “why don’t you do it?” “me oh ... okay ...” harry had not expected this but cleared his throat and said loudly wand aloft “accio horcruxl” with a noise like an explosion something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away before harry could see what it was it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great deep ripples on the mirrored surface. harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall his heart was still thundering as he turned to dumbledore. “what was that?” “something i think that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the horcrux.” harry looked back at the water. the surface of the lake was once more shining black glass the ripples had vanished unnaturally fast harry’s heart however was still pounding. “did you think that would happen sir?” “i thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the horcrux. that was a very good idea harry much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.” “but we don’t know what the thing was,” said harry looking at the sinisterly smooth water. “what the things are you mean,” said dumbledore. “i doubt very much that there is only one of them. shall we walk on?” “professor?” “yes harry?” “do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?” “into it only if we are very unfortunate.” “you don’t think the horcrux is at the bottom?” “oh no ... i think the horcrux is in the middle.” and dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake. “so we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?” “yes i think so.” harry did not say anything. his thoughts were all of water monsters of giant serpents of demons kelpies and sprites. ... “aha,” said dumbledore and he stopped again this time harry really did walk into him for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water and dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm pulling him back. “so sorry harry i should have given warning. stand back against the wall please i think i have found the place.” harry had no idea what dumbledore meant this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell but dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. this time he was running his hand not over the rocky wall but through the thin air as though expecting to find and grip something invisible. “oho,” said dumbledore happily seconds later. his hand had closed in midair upon something harry could not see. dumbledore moved closer to the water harry watched nervously as the tips of dumbledore ’s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. keeping his hand clenched in midair dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point. immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air extending from the depths of the water into dumbledore ’s clenched hand. dumbledore tapped the chain which began to slide through his fist like a snake coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls pulling something from the depths of the black water. harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface glowing as green as the chain and floated with barely a ripple toward the place on the bank where harry and dumbledore stood. “how did you know that was there?” harry asked in astonishment. “magic always leaves traces,” said dumbledore as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump “sometimes very distinctive traces. i taught tom riddle. i know his style.” “is ... is this boat safe?” “oh yes i think so. voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his horcrux.” “so the things in the water won’t do anything to us if we cross in voldemort’s boat?” “i think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will at some point realize we are not lord voldemort. thus far however we have done well. they have allowed us to raise the boat.” “but why have they let us?” asked harry who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank. “voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,” said dumbledore. “i think he would have been prepared to risk what was to his mind the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. we shall see whether he is right.” harry looked down into the boat. it really was very small. “it doesn’t look like it was built for two people. will it hold both of us will we be too heavy together?” dumbledore chuckled. “voldemort will not have cared about the weight but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. i rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.” “but then — ” “i do not think you will count harry you are underage and unqualified. voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place i think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.” these words did nothing to raise harry’s morale perhaps dumbledore knew it for he added “voldemort’s mistake harry voldemort’s mistake ... age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. ... now you first this time and be careful not to touch the water.” dumbledore stood aside and harry climbed carefully into the boat. dumbledore stepped in too coiling the chain onto the floor. they were crammed in together harry could not comfortably sit but crouched his knees jutting over the edge of the boat which began to move at once. there was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat’s prow cleaving the water it moved without their help as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern they might have been at sea except that there were no waves. harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. the boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface grooves in the dark mirror. and then harry saw it marble white floating inches below the surface. “professor!” he said and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water. “harry?” “i think i saw a hand in the water — a human hand!” “yes i am sure you did,” said dumbledore calmly. harry stared down into the water looking for the vanished hand and a sick feeling rose in his throat. “so that thing that jumped out of the water — ” but harry had his answer before dumbledore could reply the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him this time a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. “there are bodies in here!” said harry and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own. “yes,” said dumbledore placidly “but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.” “at the moment?” harry repeated tearing his gaze from the water to look at dumbledore. “not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,” said dumbledore. “there is nothing to be feared from a body harry any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. lord voldemort who of course secretly fears both disagrees. but once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. it is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more.” harry said nothing he did not want to argue but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and what was more he did not believe that they were not dangerous. “but one of them jumped,” he said trying to make his voice as level and calm as dumbledore ’s. “when i tried to summon the horcrux a body leapt out of the lake.” “yes,” said dumbledore. “i am sure that once we take the horcrux we shall find them less peaceable. however like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness they fear light and warmth which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. fire harry,” dumbledore added with a smile in response to harry’s bewildered expression. “oh ... right ...” said harry quickly. he turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. he could not pretend now that he was not scared. the great black lake teeming with the dead ... it seemed hours and hours ago that he had met professor trelawney that he had given ron and hermione felix felicis. ... he suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn’t seen ginny at all. ... “nearly there,” said dumbledore cheerfully. sure enough the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last and within minutes the boat had come to a halt bumping gently into something that harry could not see at first but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. “careful not to touch the water,” said dumbledore again as harry climbed out of the boat. the island was no larger than dumbledore ’s office an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light which looked much brighter when viewed close to. harry squinted at it at first he thought it was a lamp of some kind but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the pensieve which was set on top of a pedestal. dumbledore approached the basin and harry followed. side by side they looked down into it. the basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow. “what is it?” asked harry quietly. “i am not sure,” said dumbledore. “something more worrisome than blood and bodies however.” dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. “sir no don’t touch — !” “i cannot touch,” said dumbledore smiling faintly. “see i cannot approach any nearer than this. you try.” staring harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. he met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. no matter how hard he pushed his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air. “out of the way please harry,” said dumbledore. he raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion murmuring soundlessly. nothing happened except perhaps that the potion glowed a little brighter. harry remained silent while dumbledore worked but after a while dumbledore withdrew his wand and harry felt it was safe to talk again. “you think the horcrux is in there sir?” “oh yes.” dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. harry saw his face reflected upside down in the smooth surface of the green potion. “but how to reach it this potion cannot be penetrated by hand vanished parted scooped up or siphoned away nor can it be transfigured charmed or otherwise made to change its nature.” almost absentmindedly dumbledore raised his wand again twirled it once in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. “i can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.” “what?” said harry. “no!” “yes i think so only by drinking it can i empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.” “but what if — what if it kills you?” “oh i doubt that it would work like that,” said dumbledore easily. “lord voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.” harry couldn’t believe it. was this more of dumbledore ’s insane determination to see good in everyone “sir,” said harry trying to keep his voice reasonable “sir this is voldemort we’re — ” “i’m sorry harry i should have said he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island,” dumbledore corrected himself. “he would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and most importantly of all why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. do not forget that lord voldemort believes that he alone knows about his horcruxes.” harry made to speak again but this time dumbledore raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard. “undoubtedly,” he said finally “this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the horcrux. it might paralyze me cause me to forget what i am here for create so much pain i am distracted or render me incapable in some other way. this being the case harry it will be your job to make sure i keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. you understand?” their eyes met over the basin each pale face lit with that strange green light. harry did not speak. was this why he had been invited along — so that he could force-feed dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain “you remember,” said dumbledore “the condition on which i brought you with me?” harry hesitated looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin. “but what if — ” “you swore did you not to follow any command i gave you?” “yes but — ” “i warned you did i not that there might be danger?” “yes,” said harry “but — ” “well then,” said dumbledore shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet “you have my orders.” “why can’t i drink the potion instead?” asked harry desperately. “because i am much older much cleverer and much less valuable,” said dumbledore. “once and for all harry do i have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?” “couldn’t — ” “do i have it?” “but — ” “ your word harry.” “i — all right but — ” before harry could make any further protest dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion. for a split second harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had when the glass was full to the brim dumbledore lifted it to his mouth. “your good health harry.” and he drained the goblet. harry watched terrified his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb. “professor?” he said anxiously as dumbledore lowered the empty glass. “how do you feel?” dumbledore shook his head his eyes closed. harry wondered whether he was in pain. dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin refilled it and drank once more. in silence dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. then halfway through the fourth goblet he staggered and fell forward against the basin. his eyes were still closed his breathing heavy. “professor dumbledore?” said harry his voice strained. “can you hear me?” dumbledore did not answer. his face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream. his grip on the goblet was slackening the potion was about to spill from it. harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup holding it steady. “professor can you hear me?” he repeated loudly his voice echoing around the cavern. dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice harry did not recognize for he had never heard dumbledore frightened like this. “i don’t want ... don’t make me ...” harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles and did not know what to do. ... don’t like ... want to stop ...” moaned dumbledore. “you ... you can’t stop professor,” said harry. “you’ve got to keep drinking remember you told me you had to keep drinking. here ...” hating himself repulsed by what he was doing harry forced the goblet back toward dumbledore ’s mouth and tipped it so that dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside. “no ...” he groaned as harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. “i don’t want to. ...i don’t want to. ... let me go. ...” “it’s all right professor,” said harry his hand shaking. “it’s all right i’m here — ” “make it stop make it stop,” moaned dumbledore. “yes ... yes this’ll make it stop,” lied harry. he tipped the contents of the goblet into dumbledore ’s open mouth. dumbledore screamed the noise echoed all around the vast chamber across the dead black water. “no no no no i can’t i can’t don’t make me i don’t want to. ...” “it’s all right professor it’s all right!” said harry loudly his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion the basin was now half empty. “nothing’s happening to you you’re safe it isn’t real i swear it isn’t real — take this now take this. ...” and obediently dumbledore drank as though it was an antidote harry offered him but upon draining the goblet he sank to his knees shaking uncontrollably. “it’s all my fault all my fault,” he sobbed. “please make it stop i know i did wrong oh please make it stop and i’ll never never again ...” “this will make it stop professor,” harry said his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into dumbledore’s mouth. dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from harry’s trembling hands as he moaned “don’t hurt them don’t hurt them please please it’s my fault hurt me instead ...” “here drink this drink this you’ll be all right,” said harry desperately and once again dumbledore obeyed him opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. and now he fell forward screaming again hammering his fists upon the ground while harry filled the ninth goblet. “please please please no ... not that not that i’ll do anything ...” “just drink professor just drink ...” dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst but when he had finished he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. “no more please no more ...” harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. “we’re nearly there professor. drink this drink it. ...” he supported dumbledore’s shoulders and again dumbledore drained the glass then harry was on his feet once more refilling the goblet as dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever “i want to die! i want to die! make it stop make it stop i want to die!” “drink this professor. drink this. ...” dumbledore drank and no sooner had he finished than he yelled “kill me!” “this — this one will!” gasped harry. “just drink this ... it’ll be over ... all over!” dumbledore gulped at the goblet drained every last drop and then with a great rattling gasp rolled over onto his face. “no!” shouted harry who had stood to refill the goblet again instead he dropped the cup into the basin flung himself down beside dumbledore and heaved him over onto his back dumbledore’s glasses were askew his mouth agape his eyes closed. “no,” said harry shaking dumbledore “no you’re not dead you said it wasn’t poison wake up wake up — rennervatel” he cried his wand pointing at dumbledore’s chest there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. “renneruate — sir — please — ” dumbledore’s eyelids flickered harry’s heart leapt. “sir are you — ” “water,” croaked dumbledore. “water,” panted harry. “yes — ” he leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it. “aguamenti\” he shouted jabbing the goblet with his wand. the goblet filled with clear water harry dropped to his knees beside dumbledore raised his head and brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty. dumbledore groaned and began to pant. “but i had some — wait — aguamentiv’ said harry again pointing his wand at the goblet. once more for a second clear water gleamed within it but as he approached dumbledore ’s mouth the water vanished again. “sir i’m trying i’m trying!” said harry desperately but he did not think that dumbledore could hear him he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. “aguamenti — aguamenti — a guamentp. ” the goblet filled and emptied once more. and now dumbledore ’s breathing was fading. his brain whirling in panic harry knew instinctively the only way left to get water because voldemort had planned it so ... he flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish. “sir — here!” harry yelled and lunging forward he tipped the water clumsily over dumbledore’s face. it was the best he could do for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. a slimy white hand had gripped his wrist and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him slowly backward across the rock. the surface of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth it was churning and everywhere harry looked white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water men and women and children with sunken sightless eyes were moving toward the rock an army of the dead rising from the black water. “petrificus totalusl” yelled harry struggling to cling to the smooth soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the inferius that had his arm it released him falling backward into the water with a splash he scrambled to his feet but many more inferi were already climbing onto the rock their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface their blank frosted eyes upon him trailing waterlogged rags sunken faces leering. “petrificus totalusl” harry bellowed again backing away as he swiped his wand through the air six or seven of them crumpled but more were coming toward him. “impedimental incarcerousl ” a few of them stumbled one or two of them bound in ropes but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. still slashing at the air with his wand harry yelled “ sectumsempral sectumsempral” but though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin they had no blood to spill they walked on unfeeling their shrunken hands outstretched toward him and as he backed away still farther he felt arms enclose him from behind thin fleshless arms cold as death and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him slowly and surely back to the water and he knew there would be no release that he would be drowned and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of voldemort’s shattered soul. ... but then through the darkness fire erupted crimson and gold a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the inferi holding harry so tightly stumbled and faltered they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. they dropped harry he hit the ground slipped on the rock and fell grazing his arms but scrambled back up raising his wand and staring around. dumbledore was on his feet again pale as any of the surrounding inferi but taller than any too the fire dancing in his eyes his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames like a vast lasso encircling them all with warmth. the inferi bumped into each other attempting blindly to escape the fire in which they were enclosed. ... dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. wordlessly he gestured to harry to come to his side. distracted by the flames the inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as dumbledore led harry back to the boat the ring of fire moving with them around them the bewildered inferi accompanying them to the water’s edge where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. harry who was shaking all over thought for a moment that dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat he staggered a little as he attempted it all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. once they were both safely jammed inside again the boat began to move back across the black water away from the rock still encircled by that ring of fire and it seemed that the inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface. “sir,” panted harry “sir i forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and i panicked — ” “quite understandable,” murmured dumbledore. harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. they reached the bank with a little bump and harry leapt out then turned quickly to help dumbledore. the moment that dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall the ring of fire vanished but the inferi did not emerge again from the water. the little boat sank into the water once more clanking and tinkling its chain slithered back into the lake too. dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall. “i am weak. ...” he said. “don’t worry sir,” said harry at once anxious about dumbledore ’s extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. “don’t worry i’ll get us back. ... lean on me sir. ...” and pulling dumbledore ’s uninjured arm around his shoulders harry guided his headmaster back around the lake bearing most of his weight. “the protection was ... after all ... well-designed,” said dumbledore faintly. “one alone could not have done it. ... you did well very well harry. ...” “don’t talk now,” said harry fearing how slurred dumbledore’s voice had become how much his feet dragged. “save your energy sir. ... we’ll soon be out of here. ...” “the archway will have sealed again. ... my knife ...” “there’s no need i got cut on the rock,” said harry firmly. “just tell me where. ...” “here ...” harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly. they crossed the outer cave and harry helped dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff. “it’s going to be all right sir,” harry said over and over again more worried by dumbledore’s silence than he had been by his weakened voice. “we’re nearly there. ... i can apparate us both back. ... don’t worry. ...” “i am not worried harry,” said dumbledore his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. “i am with you.” the lightning-struck tower once back under the starry sky harry heaved dumbledore onto the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. sodden and shivering dumbledore’s weight still upon him harry concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination hogsmeade. closing his eyes gripping dumbledore’s arm as tightly as he could he stepped forward into that feeling of horrible compression. he knew it had worked before he opened his eyes the smell of salt the sea breeze had gone. he and dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark high street in hogsmeade. for one horrible moment harry’s imagination showed him more inferi creeping toward him around the sides of shops but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring all was still the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows. “we did it professor!” harry whispered with difficulty he suddenly realized that he had a searing stitch in his chest. “we did it! we got the horcrux!” dumbledore staggered against him. for a moment harry thought that his inexpert apparition had thrown dumbledore off balance then he saw his face paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp. “sir are you all right?” “i’ve been better,” said dumbledore weakly though the corners of his mouth twitched. “that potion ... was no health drink. ...” and to harry’s horror dumbledore sank onto the ground. “sir — it’s okay sir you’re going to be all right don’t worry — ” he looked around desperately for help but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing. “we need to get you up to the school sir. ... madam pomfrey ...” “no,” said dumbledore. “it is ... professor snape whom i need. ... but i do not think ... i can walk very far just yet. ...” “right — sir listen — i’m going to knock on a door find a place you can stay — then i can run and get madam — ” “severus,” said dumbledore clearly. “i need severus. “all right then snape — but i’m going to have to leave you for a moment so i can — ” before harry could make a move however he heard running footsteps. his heart leapt somebody had seen somebody knew they needed help — and looking around he saw madam rosmerta scurrying down the dark street toward them on high-heeled fluffy slippers wearing a silk dressing gown embroidered with dragons. “i saw you apparate as i was pulling my bedroom curtains! thank goodness thank goodness i couldn’t think what to — but what’s wrong with albus?” she came to a halt panting and stared down wide eyed at dumbledore. “he’s hurt,” said harry. “madam rosmerta can he come into the three broomsticks while i go up to the school and get help for him?” “you can’t go up there alone! don’t you realize — haven’t you seen —  “if you help me support him,” said harry not listening to her “i think we can get him inside — ” “what has happened?” asked dumbledore. “rosmerta what’s wrong?” “the — the dark mark albus.” and she pointed into the sky in the direction of hogwarts. dread flooded harry at the sound of the words. ... he turned and looked. there it was hanging in the sky above the school the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue the mark death eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered. ... “when did it appear?” asked dumbledore and his hand clenched painfully upon harry’s shoulder as he struggled to his feet. “must have been minutes ago it wasn’t there when i put the cat out but when i got upstairs — ” “we need to return to the castle at once,” said dumbledore. “rosmerta” — and though he staggered a little he seemed wholly in command of the situation — “we need transport — brooms — ” “i’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said looking very frightened. “shall i run and fetch — ” “no harry can do it.” harry raised his wand at once. “accio rosmerta’s broomsl” a second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to harry’s side where they stopped dead quivering slightly at waist height. “rosmerta please send a message to the ministry,” said dumbledore as he mounted the broom nearest him. “it might be that nobody within hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . harry put on your invisibility cloak.” harry pulled his cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom madam rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as harry and dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. as they sped toward the castle harry glanced sideways at dumbledore ready to grab him should he fall but the sight of the dark mark seemed to have acted upon dumbledore like a stimulant he was bent low over his broom his eyes fixed upon the mark his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air. and harry too looked ahead at the skull and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble compressing his lungs driving all other discomfort from his mind. ... how long had they been away had ron hermione and ginny’s luck run out by now was it one of them who had caused the mark to be set over the school or was it neville or luna or some other member of the d.a. and if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds. ... would he be responsible again for the death of a friend as they flew over the dark twisting lane down which they had walked earlier harry heard over the whistling of the night air in his ears dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. he thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed. the dark mark was glittering directly above the astronomy tower the highest of the castle. did that mean the death had occurred there dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around. the ramparts were deserted. the door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. there was no sign of a struggle of a fight to the death of a body. “what does it mean?” harry asked dumbledore looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue glinting evilly above them. “is it the real mark has someone definitely been — professor?” in the dim green glow from the mark harry saw dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand. “go and wake severus,” said dumbledore faintly but clearly. “tell him what has happened and bring him to me. do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak. i shall wait here.” “but — ” “you swore to obey me harry — go!” harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. he looked around at dumbledore who gestured him to retreat. harry backed away drawing his wand as he did so. the door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted “expelliarmus\” harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall propped like an unsteady statue unable to move or speak. he could not understand how it had happened — expelliarmus was not a freezing charm — then by the light of the mark he saw dumbledore ’s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood. ... dumbledore had wordlessly immobilized harry and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself. standing against the ramparts very white in the face dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. he merely looked across at his disarmer and said “good evening draco.” malfoy stepped forward glancing around quickly to check that he and dumbledore were alone. his eyes fell upon the second broom. “who else is here?” “a question i might ask you. or are you acting alone?” harry saw malfoy’s pale eyes shift back to dumbledore in the greenish glare of the mark. “no,” he said. “i’ve got backup. there are death eaters here in your school tonight.” “well well,” said dumbledore as though malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project. “very good indeed. you found a way to let them in did you?” “yeah,” said malfoy who was panting. “right under your nose and you never realized!” “ingenious,” said dumbledore. “yet ... forgive me ... where are they now you seem unsupported.” “they met some of your guards. they’re having a fight down below. they won’t be long. ... i came on ahead. i — i’ve got a job to do.” “well then you must get on and do it my dear boy,” said dumbledore softly. there was silence. harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible paralyzed body staring at the two of them his ears straining to hear sounds of the death eaters’ distant fight and in front of him draco malfoy did nothing but stare at albus dumbledore who incredibly smiled. “draco draco you are not a killer.” “how do you know?” said malfoy at once. he seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded harry saw him flush in the mark’s greenish light. “you don’t know what i’m capable of,” said malfoy more forcefully. “you don’t know what i’ve done!” “oh yes i do,” said dumbledore mildly. “you almost killed katie bell and ronald weasley. you have been trying with increasing desperation to kill me all year. forgive me draco but they have been feeble attempts. ... so feeble to be honest that i wonder whether your heart has been really in it.” “it has been in it!” said malfoy vehemently. “i’ve been working on it all year and tonight — ” somewhere in the depths of the castle below harry heard a muffled yell. malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder. “somebody is putting up a good fight,” said dumbledore conversationally. “but you were saying ... yes you have managed to introduce death eaters into my school which i admit i thought impossible. . . . how did you do it?” but malfoy said nothing he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as harry was. “perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” suggested dumbledore. “what if your backup has been thwarted by my guard as you have perhaps realized there are members of the order of the phoenix here tonight too. and after all you don’t really need help. ... i have no wand at the moment. ... i cannot defend myself.” malfoy merely stared at him. “i see,” said dumbledore kindly when malfoy neither moved nor spoke. “you are afraid to act until they join you.” “i’m not afraid!” snarled malfoy though he still made no move to hurt dumbledore. “it’s you who should be scared!” “but why i don’t think you will kill me draco. killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe. ... so tell me while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here it seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.” malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout or to vomit. he gulped and took several deep breaths glaring at dumbledore his wand pointing directly at the latter’s heart. then as though he could not help himself he said “i had to mend that broken vanishing cabinet that no one’s used for years. the one montague got lost in last year.” “aaaah.” dumbledore’s sigh was half a groan. he closed his eyes for a moment. “that was clever. ... there is a pair i take it?” “in borgin and burkes,” said malfoy “and they make a kind of passage between them. montague told me that when he was stuck in the hogwarts one he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school and sometimes what was going on in the shop as if the cabinet was traveling between them but he couldn’t make anyone hear him. ... in the end he managed to apparate out even though he’d never passed his test. he nearly died doing it. everyone thought it was a really good story but i was the only one who realized what it meant — even borgin didn’t know — i was the one who realized there could be a way into hogwarts through the cabinets if i fixed the broken one.” “very good,” murmured dumbledore. “so the death eaters were able to pass from borgin and burkes into the school to help you. ... a clever plan a very clever plan ... and as you say right under my nose.” “yeah,” said malfoy who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from dumbledore’s praise. “yeah it was!” “but there were times,” dumbledore went on “weren’t there when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet and you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands . . poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance i might drink. ...” “yeah well you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff did you?” sneered malfoy as dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts the strength in his legs apparently fading and harry struggled fruitlessly mutely against the enchantment binding him. “as a matter of fact i did,” said dumbledore. “i was sure it was you. “why didn’t you stop me then?” malfoy demanded. “i tried draco. professor snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders — ” “he hasn’t been doing your orders he promised my mother — ” “of course that is what he would tell you draco but “he’s a double agent you stupid old man he isn’t working for you you just think he is!” “we must agree to differ on that draco. it so happens that i trust professor snape — ” “well you’re losing your grip then!” sneered malfoy. “he’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for himself — wanting a bit of the action — what are you doing?’ ‘did you do the necklace that was stupid it could have blown everything — ’ but i haven’t told him what i’ve been doing in the room of requirement he’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and he won’t be the dark lord’s favorite anymore he’ll be nothing compared to me nothing!” “very gratifying,” said dumbledore mildly. “we all like appreciation for our own hard work of course. but you must have had an accomplice all the same ... someone in hogsmeade someone who was able to slip katie the — the — aaaah ...” dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded as though he was about to fall asleep. ... of course ... rosmerta. how long has she been under the imperius curse?” “got there at last have you?” malfoy taunted. there was another yell from below rather louder than the last. malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again then back at dumbledore who went on “so poor rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied and the poisoned mead ... well naturally rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to slughorn believing that it was to be my christmas present. ... yes very neat ... very neat ... poor mr. filch would not of course think to check a bottle of rosmerta’s. tell me how have you been communicating with rosmerta i thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.” “enchanted coins,” said malfoy as though he was compelled to keep talking though his wand hand was shaking badly. “i had one and she had the other and i could send her messages — ” “isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves dumbledore ’s army used last year?” asked dumbledore. his voice was light and conversational but harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it. “yeah i got the idea from them,” said malfoy with a twisted smile. “i got the idea of poisoning the mead from the mudblood granger as well i heard her talking in the library about filch not recognizing potions.” “please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” said dumbledore. malfoy gave a harsh laugh. “you care about me saying ‘mudblood’ when i’m about to kill you?” “yes i do,” said dumbledore and harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. “but as for being about to kill me draco you have had several long minutes now we are quite alone i am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me and still you have not acted. malfoy’s mouth contorted involuntarily as though he had tasted something very bitter. “now about tonight,” dumbledore went on “i am a little puzzled about how it happened. ... you knew that i had left the school but of course,” he answered his own question “rosmerta saw me leaving she tipped you off using your ingenious coins i’m sure.” “that’s right,” said malfoy. “but she said you were just going for a drink you’d be back. ...” “well i certainly did have a drink ... and i came back ... after a fashion,” mumbled dumbledore. “so you decided to spring a trap for me?” “we decided to put the dark mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here to see who’d been killed,” said malfoy. “and it worked!” “well ... yes and no ...” said dumbledore. “but am i to take it then that nobody has been murdered?” “someone’s dead,” said malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. “one of your people ...i don’t know who it was dark. ... i stepped over the body. ... i was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back only your phoenix lot got in the way. ...” “yes they do that,” said dumbledore. there was a bang and shouts from below louder than ever it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where dumbledore malfoy and harry stood and harry’s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest. ... someone was dead. . . . malfoy had stepped over the body . . . but who was it “there is little time one way or another,” said dumbledore. “so let us discuss your options draco.” “my options!” said malfoy loudly. “i’m standing here with a wand — i’m about to kill you — ” “my dear boy let us have no more pretense about that. if you were going to kill me you would have done it when you first disarmed me you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.” “i haven’t got any options!” said malfoy and he was suddenly white as dumbledore. “i’ve got to do it! he’ll kill me! he’ll kill my whole family!” “i appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said dumbledore. “why else do you think i have not confronted you before now because i knew that you would have been murdered if lord voldemort realized that i suspected you.” malfoy winced at the sound of the name. “i did not dare speak to you of the mission with which i knew you had been entrusted in case he used legilimency against you,” continued dumbledore. “but now at last we can speak plainly to each other. ... no harm has been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived. ... i can help you draco.” “no you can’t,” said malfoy his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. “nobody can. he told me to do it or he’ll kill me. i’ve got no choice.” “come over to the right side draco and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. what is more i can send members of the order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. your father is safe at the moment in azkaban. ... when the time comes we can protect him too. come over to the right side draco ... you are not a killer. ...” malfoy stared at dumbledore. “but i got this far didn’t i?” he said slowly. “they thought i’d die in the attempt but i’m here ... and you’re in my power. ... i’m the one with the wand. ... you’re at my mercy. ...” “no draco,” said dumbledore quietly. “it is my mercy and not yours that matters now.” malfoy did not speak. his mouth was open his wand hand still trembling. harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction — but suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts. still paralyzed his eyes staring unblinkingly harry gazed in terror upon four strangers it seemed the death eaters had won the fight below. a lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle. “dumbledore cornered!” he said and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. “dumbledore wandless dumbledore alone! well done draco well done!” “good evening amycus,” said dumbledore calmly as though welcoming the man to a tea party. “and you’ve brought alecto too. ... charming ...” the woman gave an angry little titter. “think your little jokes’ll help you on your deathbed then?” she jeered. “jokes no no these are manners,” replied dumbledore. “do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to harry a big rangy man with matted gray hair and whiskers whose black death eater’s robes looked uncomfortably tight. he had a voice like none that harry had ever heard a rasping bark of a voice. harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt sweat and unmistakably of blood coming from him. his filthy hands had long yellowish nails. “is that you fenrir?” asked dumbledore. “that’s right,” rasped the other. “pleased to see me dumbledore?” “no i cannot say that i am.” greyback grinned showing pointed teeth. blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly obscenely. “but you know how much i like kids dumbledore.” “am i to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now this is most unusual. ... you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?” “that’s right,” said fenrir greyback. “shocks you that does it dumbledore frightens you?” “well i cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” said dumbledore. “and yes i am a little shocked that draco here invited you of all people into the school where his friends live. ...” “i didn’t,” breathed malfoy. he was not looking at fenrir he did not seem to want to even glance at him. “i didn’t know he was going to come — ” “i wouldn’t want to miss a trip to hogwarts dumbledore,” rasped greyback. “not when there are throats to be ripped out... delicious delicious ...” and he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth leering at dumbledore. “i could do you for afters dumbledore.” “no,” said the fourth death eater sharply. he had a heavy brutal-looking face. “we’ve got orders. draco’s got to do it. now draco and quickly.” malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. he looked terrified as he stared into dumbledore ’s face which was even paler and rather lower than usual as he had slid so far down the rampart wall. “he’s not long for this world anyway if you ask me!” said the lopsided man to the accompaniment of his sister’s wheezing giggles. “look at him — what’s happened to you then dumby?” “oh weaker resistance slower reflexes amycus,” said dumbledore. “old age in short ... one day perhaps it will happen to you ... if you are lucky. ...” “what’s that mean then what’s that mean?” yelled the death eater suddenly violent. “always the same weren’t yeh dumby talking and doing nothing nothing. i don’t even know why the dark lord’s bothering to kill yer! come on draco do it!” but at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted “ they’ve blocked the stairs — reductol reductol” harry’s heart leapt so these four had not eliminated all opposition but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower and by the sound of it created a barrier behind them — “now draco quickly!” said the brutal-faced man angrily. but malfoy’s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim. “i’ll do it,” snarled fenrir moving toward dumbledore with his hands outstretched his teeth bared. “i said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way he hit the ramparts and staggered looking furious. harry’s heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there imprisoned by dumbledore ’s spell — if he could only move he could aim a curse from under the cloak — “draco do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched the woman but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood snape his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene from dumbledore slumped against the wall to the four death eaters including the enraged werewolf and malfoy. “we’ve got a problem snape,” said the lumpy amycus whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon dumbledore “the boy doesn’t seem able — ” but somebody else had spoken snape’s name quite softly. “severus ...” the sound frightened harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. for the first time dumbledore was pleading. snape said nothing but walked forward and pushed malfoy roughly out of the way. the three death eaters fell back without a word. even the werewolf seemed cowed. snape gazed for a moment at dumbledore and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. “severus ... please ...” snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at dumbledore. “avada kedavrav’ a jet of green light shot from the end of snape’s wand and hit dumbledore squarely in the chest. harry’s scream of horror never left him silent and unmoving he was forced to watch as dumbledore was blasted into the air. for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull and then he fell slowly backward like a great rag doll over the battlements and out of sight. flight of the prince harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space it had not happened. ...it could not have happened. ... “out of here quickly,” said snape. he seized malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest greyback and the squat brother and sister followed the latter both panting excitedly. as they vanished through the door harry realized he could move again. what was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic but horror and shock. he threw the invisibility cloak aside as the brutal-faced death eater last to leave the tower top was disappearing through the door. “petrificus totalusl” the death eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground rigid as a waxwork but he had barely hit the floor when harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase. terror tore at harry’s heart. ... he had to get to dumbledore and he had to catch snape. ... somehow the two things were linked. ... he could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. . . . dumbledore could not have died. ... he leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed his wand raised the dimly lit corridor was full of dust half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in and a battle was raging before him but even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom he heard the hated voice shout “it’s over time to go\” and saw snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor he and malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. as harry plunged after them one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him it was the werewolf fenrir. he was on top of harry before harry could raise his wand harry fell backward with filthy matted hair in his face the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth hot greedy breath at his throat — “petrificus totalusl” harry felt fenrir collapse against him with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him he ducked and ran headfirst into the fight. his feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled there were two bodies lying there lying facedown in a pool of blood but there was no time to investigate. harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy death eater amycus who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them amycus was giggling enjoying the sport “crucio — crucio — you can’t dance forever pretty — ” “impedimenta).” yelled harry. his jinx hit amycus in the chest he gave a piglike squeal of pain was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall slid down it and fell out of sight behind ron professor mcgonagall and lupin each of whom was battling a separate death eater. beyond them harry saw tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions so that they ricocheted off the walls around them cracking stone shattering the nearest window — “harry where did you come from?” ginny cried but there was no time to answer her. he put his head down and sprinted forward narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head showering them all in bits of wall. snape must not escape he must catch up with snape — “take that\” shouted professor mcgonagall and harry glimpsed the female death eater alecto sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head her brother right behind her. he launched himself after them but his foot caught on something and next moment he was lying across someone’s legs. looking around he saw neville’s pale round face flat against the floor. “neville are you — ” “m’all right,” muttered neville who was clutching his stomach “harry ... snape ’n’ malfoy ... ran past ...” “i know i’m on it!” said harry aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond death eater who was causing most of the chaos. the man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face he wheeled around staggered and then pounded away after the brother and sister. harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him the yells of the others to come back and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. ... he skidded around the corner his trainers slippery with blood snape had an immense head start. was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the room of requirement or had the order made steps to secure it to prevent the death eaters retreating that way he could hear nothing but his own pounding feet his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing death eaters was heading toward the front doors — perhaps the room of requirement was indeed blocked — he skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. he saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. as he leapt the wreckage of armor harry heard more shouts and screams other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. ... he pelted toward a shortcut hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on snape and malfoy who must surely have reached the grounds by now. remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad hufflepuffs stood. “harry! we heard a noise and someone said something about the dark mark — ” began ernie macmillan. “out of the way!” yelled harry knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. the oak front doors had been blasted open there were smears of blood on the flagstones and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. the giant gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse and the rubies within were still falling with a loud rattle onto the flagstones below. harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds he could just make out three figures racing across the lawn heading for the gates beyond which they could disapparate — by the looks of them the huge blond death eater and some way ahead of him snape and malfoy ... the cold night air ripped at harry’s lungs as he tore after them he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. he did not know what it was but continued to run not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse — another flash shouts retaliatory jets of light and harry understood hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the death eaters escaping and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said not hagrid . . . not hagrid too . . . something caught harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward his face smacking the ground blood pouring out of both nostrils he knew even as he rolled over his wand ready that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. ... “impedimenta).” he yelled as he rolled over again crouching close to the dark ground and miraculously his jinx hit one of them who stumbled and fell tripping up the other harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after snape. and now he saw the vast outline of hagrid illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds the blond death eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper but hagrid’s immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. snape and malfoy however were still running they would soon be beyond the gates able to disapparate — harry tore past hagrid and his opponent took aim at snape’s back and yelled “stupefy\” he missed the jet of red light soared past snape’s head snape shouted “run draco\” and turned. twenty yards apart he and harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously. “cruc — ” but snape parried the curse knocking harry backward off his feet before he could complete it harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge death eater behind him yelled “incendiol” harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them hagrid’s house was on fire. “fang’s in there yer evil — !” hagrid bellowed. “cruc — ” yelled harry for the second time aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight but snape blocked the spell again. harry could see him sneering. “no unforgivable curses from you potter!” he shouted over the rushing of the flames hagrid’s yells and the wild yelping of the trapped fang. “you haven’t got the nerve or the ability — ” “incarc — ” harry roared but snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm. “fight back!” harry screamed at him. “fight back you cowardly — ” “coward did you call me potter?” shouted snape. “your father would never attack me unless it was four on one what would you call him i wonder?” “ stupe — ” “blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed potter!” sneered snape deflecting the curse once more. “now come!” he shouted at the huge death eater behind harry. “it is time to be gone before the ministry turns up — ” “impedi — ” but before he could finish this jinx excruciating pain hit harry he keeled over in the grass. someone was screaming he would surely die of this agony snape was going to torture him to death or madness — “no!” roared snape’s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started harry lay curled on the dark grass clutching his wand and panting somewhere overhead snape was shouting “have you forgotten our orders potter belongs to the dark lord — we are to leave him! go! go!” and harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous death eater obeyed running toward the gates. harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage in that instant he cared not whether he lived or died. pushing himself to his feet again he staggered blindly toward snape the man he now hated as much as he hated voldemort himself — “sectum — !” snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again but harry was mere feet away now and he could see snape’s face clearly at last he was no longer sneering or jeering the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. mustering all his powers of concentration harry thought levi — “no potter!” screamed snape. there was a loud bang and harry was soaring backward hitting the ground hard again and this time his wand flew out of his hand. he could hear hagrid yelling and fang howling as snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay wandless and defenseless as dumbledore had been. snape’s pale face illuminated by the flaming cabin was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed dumbledore. “you dare use my own spells against me potter it was i who invented them — i the half-blood prince! and you’d turn my inventions on me like your filthy father would you i don’t think so ... no!” harry had dived for his wand snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight. “kill me then,” panted harry who felt no fear at all but only rage and contempt. “kill me like you killed him you coward — ” “dont — ” screamed snape and his face was suddenly demented inhuman as though he was in as much pain as the yelping howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them — “call me coward!” and he slashed at the air harry felt a white-hot whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. buckbeak had flown at snape who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. as harry raised himself into a sitting position his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground he saw snape running as hard as he could the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as harry had never heard him screech — harry struggled to his feet looking around groggily for his wand hoping to give chase again but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass discarding twigs he knew it would be too late and sure enough by the time he had located his wand he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. snape had managed to disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries. “hagrid,” muttered harry still dazed looking around. “hagrid?” he stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying fang on his back. with a cry of thankfulness harry sank to his knees he was shaking in every limb his body ached all over and his breath came in painful stabs. “yeh all righ’ harry yeh all righ’ speak ter me harry. ...” hagrid’s huge hairy face was swimming above harry blocking out the stars. harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him. “i’m all right,” panted harry. “are you?” “ ’course i am ... take more’n that ter finish me.” hagrid put his hands under harry’s arms and raised him up with such force that harry’s feet momentarily left the ground before hagrid set him upright again. he could see blood trickling down hagrid’s cheek from a deep cut under one eye which was swelling rapidly. “we should put out your house,” said harry “the charm’s ‘aguamenti’ ...” “knew it was summat like that,” mumbled hagrid and he raised a smoldering pink flowery umbrella and said “aguamenti\” a jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. harry raised his wand arm which felt like lead and murmured “aguamenti’ too together he and hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished. “s’not too bad,” said hagrid hopefully a few minutes later looking at the smoking wreck. “nothin’ dumbledore won’ be able to put righ’ ...” harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. in the silence and the stillness horror rose inside him. “hagrid ...” “i was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when i heard ’em cornin’,” said hagrid sadly still staring at his wrecked cabin. “they’ll’ve bin burnt ter twigs poor little things. ...” “hagrid ...” “but what happened harry i jus’ saw them death eaters runnin’ down from the castle but what the ruddy hell was snape doin’ with ’em where’s he gone — was he chasin’ them?” “he ...” harry cleared his throat it was dry from panic and the smoke. “hagrid he killed ...” “killed?” said hagrid loudly staring down at harry. “snape killed what’re yeh on abou’ harry?” “dumbledore,” said harry. “snape killed ... dumbledore.” hagrid simply looked at him the little of his face that could be seen completely blank uncomprehending. “dumbledore wha’ harry?” “he’s dead. snape killed him. ...” “don’ say that,” said hagrid roughly. “snape kill dumbledore — don’ be stupid harry. wha’s made yeh say tha’?” “i saw it happen.” “yeh couldn’ have.” “i saw it hagrid.” hagrid shook his head his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic and harry knew that hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head that he was confused perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ... “what musta happened was dumbledore musta told snape ter go with them death eaters,” hagrid said confidently. “i suppose he’s gotta keep his cover. look let’s get yeh back up ter the school. come on harry. ...” harry did not attempt to argue or explain. he was still shaking uncontrollably. hagrid would find out soon enough too soon. ... as they directed their steps back toward the castle harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. he could imagine clearly the scenes inside as people moved from room to room telling each other that death eaters had got in that the mark was shining over hogwarts that somebody must have been killed. ... the oak front doors stood open ahead of them light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. slowly uncertainly dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps looking around nervously for some sign of the death eaters who had fled into the night. harry’s eyes however were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. he imagined that he could see a black huddled mass lying in the grass there though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought dumbledore ’s body must lie however he saw people beginning to move toward it. “what’re they all lookin’ at?” said hagrid as he and harry approached the castle front fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. “wha’s tha’ lyin’ on the grass?” hagrid added sharply heading now toward the foot of the astronomy tower where a small crowd was congregating. “see it harry righ’ at the foot o’ the tower under where the mark ... blimey ... yeh don’ think someone got thrown — ” hagrid fell silent the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. harry walked alongside him feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him though in an oddly detached way as though somebody near him was suffering them. what was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. ... he and hagrid moved dreamlike through the murmuring crowd to the very front where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap. harry heard hagrid ’s moan of pain and shock but he did not stop he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. he had known there was no hope from the moment that the full body-bind curse dumbledore had placed upon him lifted known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead but there was still no preparation for seeing him here spread-eagled broken the greatest wizard harry had ever or would ever meet. dumbledore’s eyes were closed but for the strange angle of his arms and legs he might have been sleeping. harry reached out straightened the half moon spectacles upon the crooked nose and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth that never again would dumbledore speak to him never again could he help. ... the crowd murmured behind harry. after what seemed like a long time he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down. the locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of dumbledore’s pocket. it had opened perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. and although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already harry knew as he picked it up that there was something wrong. he turned the locket over in his hands. this was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the pensieve nor were there any markings upon it no sign of the ornate s that was supposed to be slytherin’s mark. moreover there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been. automatically without really thinking about what he was doing harry pulled out the fragment of parchment opened it and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him to the dark lord i know i will be dead long before you read this but i want you to know that it was i who discovered your secret i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can. i face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more. r.a.b. harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. only one thing mattered this was not a horcrux. dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eyes burned with tears as behind him fang began to howl. z the phoenix lament “c’mere harry ...” “no.” “yeh can’ stay here harry. ... come on now. ...” “no.” he did not want to leave dumbledore’s side he did not want to move anywhere. hagrid’s hand on his shoulder was trembling. then another voice said “harry come on.” a much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. he obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize from a trace of flowery scent on the air that it was ginny who was leading him back into the castle. incomprehensible voices battered him sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night but harry and ginny walked on back up the steps into the entrance hall. faces swam on the edges of harry’s vision people were peering at him whispering wondering and gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase. “we’re going to the hospital wing,” said ginny. “i’m not hurt,” said harry. “it’s mcgonagall’s orders,” said ginny. “everyone’s up there ron and hermione and lupin and everyone — ” fear stirred in harry’s chest again he had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind. “ginny who else is dead?” “don’t worry none of us.” “but the dark mark — malfoy said he stepped over a body — ” “he stepped over bill but it’s all right he’s alive.” there was something in her voice however that harry knew boded ill. “are you sure?” “of course i’m sure ... he’s a — a bit of a mess that’s all. greyback attacked him. madam pomfrey says he won’t — won’t look the same anymore. ...” ginny ’s voice trembled a little. “we don’t really know what the aftereffects will be — i mean greyback being a werewolf but not transformed at the time.” “but the others . . . there were other bodies on the ground. ...” “neville and professor flitwick are both hurt but madam pomfrey says they’ll be all right. and a death eater’s dead he got hit by a killing curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere — harry if we hadn’t had your felix potion i think we’d all have been killed but everything seemed to just miss us — ” they had reached the hospital wing. pushing open the doors harry saw neville lying apparently asleep in a bed near the door. ron hermione luna tonks and lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. at the sound of the doors opening they all looked up. hermione ran to harry and hugged him lupin moved forward too looking anxious. “are you all right harry?” “i’m fine. ... how’s bill?” nobody answered. harry looked over hermione’s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on bill’s pillow so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. madam pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. harry remembered how snape had mended malfoy’s sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand. “can’t you fix them with a charm or something?” he asked the matron. “no charm will work on these,” said madam pomfrey. “i’ve tried everything i know but there is no cure for werewolf bites.” “but he wasn’t bitten at the full moon,” said ron who was gazing down into his brother’s face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. “greyback hadn’t transformed so surely bill won’t be a — a real — ” he looked uncertainly at lupin. “no i don’t think that bill will be a true werewolf,” said lupin “but that does not mean that there won’t be some contamination. those are cursed wounds. they are unlikely ever to heal fully and — and bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.” “dumbledore might know something that’d work though,” ron said. “where is he bill fought those maniacs on dumbledore’s orders dumbledore owes him he can’t leave him in this state — ” “ron — dumbledore’s dead,” said ginny. “no!” lupin looked wildly from ginny to harry as though hoping the latter might contradict her but when harry did not lupin collapsed into a chair beside bill’s bed his hands over his face. harry had never seen lupin lose control before he felt as though he was intruding upon something private indecent. he turned away and caught ron’s eye instead exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what ginny had said. “how did he die?” whispered tonks. “how did it happen?” “snape killed him,” said harry. “i was there i saw it. we arrived back on the astronomy tower because that’s where the mark was. ... dumbledore was ill he was weak but i think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. he immobilized me i couldn’t do anything i was under the invisibility cloak — and then malfoy came through the door and disarmed him — ” hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and ron groaned. luna’s mouth trembled. “ — more death eaters arrived — and then snape — and snape did it. the avada kedavra.” harry couldn’t go on. madam pomfrey burst into tears. nobody paid her any attention except ginny who whispered “shh! listen!” gulping madam pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth her eyes wide. somewhere out in the darkness a phoenix was singing in a way harry had never heard before a stricken lament of terrible beauty. and harry felt as he had felt about phoenix song before that the music was inside him not without it was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows. how long they all stood there listening he did not know nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and professor mcgonagall entered the ward. like all the rest she bore marks of the recent battle there were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped. “molly and arthur are on their way,” she said and the spell of the music was broken everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances turning again to look at bill or else to rub their own eyes shake their heads. “harry what happened according to hagrid you were with professor dumbledore when he — when it happened. he says professor snape was involved in some — ” “snape killed dumbledore,” said harry. she stared at him for a moment then swayed alarmingly madam pomfrey who seemed to have pulled herself together ran forward conjuring a chair from thin air which she pushed under mcgonagall. “snape,” repeated mcgonagall faintly falling into the chair. “we all wondered ... but he trusted ... always ... snape ... i can’t believe it. ...” “snape was a highly accomplished occlumens,” said lupin his voice uncharacteristically harsh. “we always knew that.” “but dumbledore swore he was on our side!” whispered tonks. “i always thought dumbledore must know something about snape that we didn’t. ...” “he always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting snape,” muttered professor mcgonagall now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan edged handkerchief. “i mean ... with snape ’s history ... of course people were bound to wonder . . . but dumbledore told me explicitly that snape ’s repentance was absolutely genuine. ... wouldn’t hear a word against him!” “i’d love to know what snape told him to convince him,” said tonks. “i know,” said harry and they all turned to look at him. “snape passed voldemort the information that made voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. then snape told dumbledore he hadn’t realized what he was doing he was really sorry he’d done it sorry that they were dead.” they all stared at him. “and dumbledore believed that?” said lupin incredulously. “dumbledore believed snape was sorry james was dead snape hated james. ...” “and he didn’t think my mother was worth a damn either,” said harry “because she was muggle-born. ... ‘mudblood,’ he called her. ...” nobody asked how harry knew this. all of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened. “this is all my fault,” said professor mcgonagall suddenly. she looked disoriented twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. “my fault. i sent filius to fetch snape tonight i actually sent for him to come and help us! if i hadn’t alerted snape to what was going on he might never have joined forces with the death eaters. i don’t think he knew they were there before filius told him i don’t think he knew they were coming.” “it isn’t your fault minerva,” said lupin firmly. “we all wanted more help we were glad to think snape was on his way. ...” “so when he arrived at the fight he joined in on the death eaters’ side?” asked harry who wanted every detail of snape ’s duplicity and infamy feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him to swear vengeance. “i don’t know exactly how it happened,” said professor mcgonagall distractedly. “it’s all so confusing. ... dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case ... remus bill and nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. all seemed quiet. every secret passageway out of the school was covered. we knew nobody could fly in. there were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. i still don’t know how the death eaters can possibly have entered. ...” “i do,” said harry and he explained briefly about the pair of vanishing cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. “so they got in through the room of requirement.” almost against his will he glanced from ron to hermione both of whom looked devastated. “i messed up harry,” said ron bleakly. “we did like you told us we checked the marauder’s map and we couldn’t see malfoy on it so we thought he must be in the room of requirement so me ginny and neville went to keep watch on it ... but malfoy got past us.” “he came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,” said ginny. “he was on his own clutching that awful shriveled arm — ” “his hand of glory,” said ron. “gives light only to the holder remember?” “anyway,” ginny went on “he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the death eaters out because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black — ” “ — peruvian instant darkness powder,” said ron bitterly. “fred and george’s. i’m going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.” “we tried everything lumos incendio,” said ginny. “nothing would penetrate the darkness all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. obviously malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them but we didn’t dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other and by the time we’d reached a corridor that was light they’d gone.” “luckily,” said lupin hoarsely “ron ginny and neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. we found the death eaters minutes later heading in the direction of the astronomy tower. malfoy obviously hadn’t expected more people to be on the watch he seemed to have exhausted his supply of darkness powder at any rate. a fight broke out they scattered and we gave chase. one of them gibbon broke away and headed up the tower stairs — ” “to set off the mark?” asked harry. “he must have done yes they must have arranged that before they left the room of requirement,” said lupin. “but i don’t think gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for dumbledore because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a killing curse that just missed me.” “so if ron was watching the room of requirement with ginny and neville,” said harry turning to hermione “were you — ” “outside snape’s office yes,” whispered hermione her eyes sparkling with tears “with luna. we hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. ... we didn’t know what was going on upstairs ron had taken the map. ... it was nearly midnight when professor flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. he was shouting about death eaters in the castle i don’t think he really registered that luna and i were there at all he just burst his way into snape’s office and we heard him saying that snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — and — ” “what?” harry urged her. “i was so stupid harry!” said hermione in a high pitched whisper. “he said professor flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he — while he went to help fight the death eaters — ” she covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers so that her voice was muffled. “we went into his office to see if we could help professor flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor ... and oh it’s so obvious now snape must have stupefied flitwick but we didn’t realize harry we didn’t realize we just let snape go!” “it’s not your fault,” said lupin firmly. “hermione had you not obeyed snape and got out of the way he probably would have killed you and luna.” “so then he came upstairs,” said harry who was watching snape running up the marble staircase in his mind’s eye his black robes billowing behind him as ever pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended “and he found the place where you were all fighting. ...” “we were in trouble we were losing,” said tonks in a low voice. “gibbon was down but the rest of the death eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. neville had been hurt bill had been savaged by greyback ... it was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere ... the malfoy boy had vanished he must have slipped past up the stairs ... then more of them ran after him but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. ... neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air — ” “none of us could break through,” said ron “and that massive death eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. ...” “and then snape was there,” said tonks “and then he wasn’t — ” “i saw him running toward us but that huge death eater’s jinx just missed me right afterward and i ducked and lost track of things,” said ginny. “i saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn’t there,” said lupin. “i tried to follow him but was thrown back just like neville. ...” “he must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered mcgonagall. “after all — he was the defense against the dark arts teacher. ... i just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the death eaters who’d escaped up to the tower. ...” “he was,” said harry savagely “but to help them not to stop them ... and i’ll bet you had to have a dark mark to get through that barrier — so what happened when he came back down?” “well the big death eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in and also broke the curse blocking the stairs,” said lupin. “we all ran forward — those of us who were still standing anyway — and then snape and the boy emerged out of the dust — obviously none of us attacked them — ” “we just let them pass,” said tonks in a hollow voice. “we thought they were being chased by the death eaters — and next thing the other death eaters and greyback were back and we were fighting again — i thought i heard snape shout something but i don’t know what — ” “he shouted ‘it’s over,’ ” said harry. “he’d done what he’d meant to do.” they all fell silent. fawkes’s lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. as the music reverberated upon the air unbidden unwelcome thoughts slunk into harry’s mind. ... had they taken dumbledore’s body from the foot of the tower yet what would happen to it next where would it rest he clenched his fists tightly in his pockets. he could feel the small cold lump of the fake horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand. the doors of the hospital wing burst open making them all jump mr. and mrs. weasley were striding up the ward fleur just behind them her beautiful face terrified. “molly — arthur — ” said professor mcgonagall jumping up and hurrying to greet them. “i am so sorry — ” “bill,” whispered mrs. weasley darting past professor mcgonagall as she caught sight of bill’s mangled face. “oh bill'.” lupin and tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that mr. and mrs. weasley could get nearer to the bed. mrs. weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead. “you said greyback attacked him?” mr. weasley asked professor mcgonagall distractedly. “but he hadn’t transformed so what does that mean what will happen to bill?” “we don’t yet know,” said professor mcgonagall looking helplessly at lupin. “there will probably be some contamination arthur,” said lupin. “it is an odd case possibly unique. ... we don’t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens. ...” mrs. weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from madam pomfrey and began dabbing at bill’s wounds. “and dumbledore ...” said mr. weasley. “minerva is it true ... is he really ... ” as professor mcgonagall nodded harry felt ginny move beside him and looked at her. her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon fleur who was gazing down at bill with a frozen expression on her face. “dumbledore gone,” whispered mr. weasley but mrs. weasley had eyes only for her eldest son she began to sob tears falling onto bill’s mutilated face. “of course it doesn’t matter how he looks. ... it’s not r-really important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was g going to be married!” “and what do you mean by zat?” said fleur suddenly and loudly. “what do you mean ‘’e was going to be married?’ ” mrs. weasley raised her tear-stained face looking startled. “well — only that — ” “you theenk bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” demanded fleur. “you theenk because of these bites he will not love me?” “no that’s not what i — ” “because ’e will!” said fleur drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “it would take more zan a werewolf to stop bill loving me!” “well yes i’m sure,” said mrs. weasley “but i thought perhaps — given how — how he — ” “you thought i would not weesh to marry him or per’aps you hoped?” said fleur her nostrils flaring. “what do i care how he looks i am good-looking enough for both of us i theenk! all these scars show is zat my husband is brave! and i shall do zat!” she added fiercely pushing mrs. weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her. mrs. weasley fell back against her husband and watched fleur mopping up bill’s wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. nobody said anything harry did not dare move. like everybody else he was waiting for the explosion. “our great-auntie muriel,” said mrs. weasley after a long pause “has a very beautiful tiara — goblin-made — which i am sure i could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. she is very fond of bill you know and it would look lovely with your hair.” “thank you,” said fleur stiffly. “i am sure zat will be lovely.” and then harry did not quite see how it happened both women were crying and hugging each other. completely bewildered wondering whether the world had gone mad he turned around ron looked as stunned as he felt and ginny and hermione were exchanging startled looks. “you see!” said a strained voice. tonks was glaring at lupin. “she still wants to marry him even though he’s been bitten! she doesn’t care!” “it’s different,” said lupin barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. “bill will not be a full werewolf. the cases are completely — ” “but i don’t care either i don’t care!” said tonks seizing the front of lupin’s robes and shaking them. “i’ve told you a million times. ...” and the meaning of tonks’s patronus and her mouse colored hair and the reason she had come running to find dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by greyback all suddenly became clear to harry it had not been sirius that tonks had fallen in love with after all. “and i’ve told you a million times,” said lupin refusing to meet her eyes staring at the floor “that i am too old for you too poor ... too dangerous. ...” “i’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on this remus,” said mrs. weasley over fleur’s shoulder as she patted her on the back. “i am not being ridiculous,” said lupin steadily. “tonks deserves somebody young and whole.” “but she wants you,” said mr. weasley with a small smile. “and after all remus young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.” he gestured sadly at his son lying between them. “this is ... not the moment to discuss it,” said lupin avoiding everybody’s eyes as he looked around distractedly. “dumbledore is dead. ...” “dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,” said professor mcgonagall curtly just as the hospital doors opened again and hagrid walked in. the little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen he was shaking with tears a vast spotted handkerchief in his hand. “i’ve ... i’ve done it professor,” he choked. “m-moved him. professor sprout’s got the kids back in bed. professor flitwick’s lyin’ down but he says he’ll be all righ’ in a jiffy an’ professor slughorn says the ministry’s bin informed.” “thank you hagrid,” said professor mcgonagall standing up at once and turning to look at the group around bill’s bed. “i shall have to see the ministry when they get here. hagrid please tell the heads of houses — slughorn can represent slytherin — that i want to see them in my office forthwith. i would like you to join us too.” as hagrid nodded turned and shuffled out of the room again she looked down at harry. “before i meet them i would like a quick word with you harry. if you’ll come with me. ...” harry stood up murmured “see you in a bit” to ron hermione and ginny and followed professor mcgonagall back down the ward. the corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. it was several minutes before harry became aware that they were not heading for professor mcgonagall’s office but for dumbledore’s and another few seconds before he realized that of course she had been deputy headmistress. ... apparently she was now headmistress ... so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers. in silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. he did not know what he had expected that the room would be draped in black perhaps or even that dumbledore’s body might be lying there. in fact it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and dumbledore had left it mere hours previously the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle-legged tables gryffindor’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight the sorting hat on a shelf behind the desk. but fawkes’s perch stood empty he was still crying his lament to the grounds. and a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk his half moon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose looking peaceful and untroubled. after glancing once at this portrait professor mcgonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself then rounded the desk to look at harry her face taut and lined. “harry,” she said “i would like to know what you and professor dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.” “i can’t tell you that professor,” said harry. he had expected the question and had his answer ready. it had been here in this very room that dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but ron and hermione. “harry it might be important,” said professor mcgonagall. “it is,” said harry “very but he didn’t want me to tell anyone.” professor mcgonagall glared at him. “potter” — harry registered the renewed use of his surname — “in the light of professor dumbledore’s death i think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat — “i don’t think so,” said harry shrugging. “professor dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died.” “but — ” “there’s one thing you should know before the ministry gets here though. madam rosmerta’s under the imperius curse she was helping malfoy and the death eaters that’s how the necklace and the poisoned mead — ” “rosmerta?” said professor mcgonagall incredulously but before she could go on there was a knock on the door behind them and professors sprout flitwick and slughorn traipsed into the room followed by hagrid who was still weeping copiously his huge frame trembling with grief. “snape!” ejaculated slughorn who looked the most shaken pale and sweating. “snape! i taught him! i thought i knew him!” but before any of them could respond to this a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall a sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas. “minerva the minister will be here within seconds he has just disapparated from the ministry.” “thank you everard,” said professor mcgonagall and she turned quickly to her teachers. “i want to talk about what happens to hogwarts before he gets here,” she said quickly. “personally i am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. the death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon hogwarts ’s history. it is horrible.” “i am sure dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,” said professor sprout. “i feel that if a single pupil wants to come then the school ought to remain open for that pupil.” “but will we have a single pupil after this?” said slughorn now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. “parents will want to keep their children at home and i can’t say i blame them. personally i don’t think we’re in more danger at hogwarts than we are anywhere else but you can’t expect mothers to think like that. they’ll want to keep their families together it’s only natural.” “i agree,” said professor mcgonagall. “and in any case it is not true to say that dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which hogwarts might close. when the chamber of secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school — and i must say that professor dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of slytherin’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. ...” “we must consult the governors,” said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in snape’s office. “we must follow the established procedures. a decision should not be made hastily.” “hagrid you haven’t said anything,” said professor mcgonagall. “what are your views ought hogwarts to remain open?” hagrid who had been weeping silently into his large spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation now raised puffy red eyes and croaked “i dunno professor ... that’s fer the heads of house an’ the headmistress ter decide ...” “professor dumbledore always valued your views,” said professor mcgonagall kindly “and so do i.” “well i’m stayin’,” said hagrid fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. “it’s me home it’s bin me home since i was thirteen. an’ if there’s kids who wan’ me ter teach ’em i’ll do it. but ... i dunno ... hogwarts without dumbledore ...” he gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more and there was silence. “very well,” said professor mcgonagall glancing out of the window at the grounds checking to see whether the minister was yet approaching “then i must agree with filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors who will make the final decision. “now as to getting students home ... there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. we could arrange for the hogwarts express to come tomorrow if necessary — ” “what about dumbledore’s funeral?” said harry speaking at last. “well ...” said professor mcgonagall losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. “i — i know that it was dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest here at hogwarts — ” “then that’s what’ll happen isn’t it?” said harry fiercely. “if the ministry thinks it appropriate,” said professor mcgonagall. “no other headmaster or headmistress has ever been — ” “no other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,” growled hagrid. “hogwarts should be dumbledore’s final resting place,” said professor flitwick. “absolutely,” said professor sprout. “and in that case,” said harry “you shouldn’t send the students home until the funeral’s over. they’ll want to say — ” the last word caught in his throat but professor sprout completed the sentence for him. “good-bye.” “well said,” squeaked professor flitwick. “well said indeed! our students should pay tribute it is fitting. we can arrange transport home afterward.” “seconded,” barked professor sprout. “i suppose ... yes ...” said slughorn in a rather agitated voice while hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent. “he’s coming,” said professor mcgonagall suddenly gazing down into the grounds. “the minister ... and by the looks of it he’s brought a delegation ...” “can i leave professor?” said harry at once. he had no desire at all to see or be interrogated by rufus scrimgeour tonight. “you may,” said professor mcgonagall. “and quickly.” she strode toward the door and held it open for him. he sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor he had left his invisibility cloak at the top of the astronomy tower but it did not matter there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass not even filch mrs. norris or peeves. he did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the gryffindor common room. “is it true?” whispered the fat lady as he approached her. “it is really true dumbledore — dead?” “yes,” said harry. she let out a wail and without waiting for the password swung forward to admit him. as harry had suspected it would be the common room was jam-packed. the room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. he saw dean and seamus sitting in a group nearby this meant that the dormitory must be empty or nearly so. without speaking to anybody without making eye contact at all harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys’ dormitories. as he had hoped ron was waiting for him still fully dressed sitting on his bed. harry sat down on his own four-poster and for a moment they simply stared at each other. “they’re talking about closing the school,” said harry. “lupin said they would,” said ron. there was a pause. “so?” said ron in a very low voice as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. “did you find one did you get it a — a horcrux?” harry shook his head. all that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now had it really happened and only hours ago “you didn’t get it?” said ron looking crestfallen. “it wasn’t there?” “no,” said harry. “someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place.” “already taken — ” wordlessly harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket opened it and passed it to ron. the full story could wait. ... it did not matter tonight ... nothing mattered except the end the end of their pointless adventure the end of dumbledore’s life. ... “r.a.b.,” whispered ron “but who was that?” “dunno,” said harry lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. he felt no curiosity at all about r.a.b. he doubted that he would ever feel curious again. as he lay there he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. fawkes had stopped singing. and he knew without knowing how he knew it that the phoenix had gone had left hogwarts for good just as dumbledore had left the school had left the world . . . had left harry. the white tomb all lessons were suspended all examinations postponed. some students were hurried away from hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days — the patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following dumbledore’s death and zacharias smith was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father. seamus finnigan on the other hand refused point-blank to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. she had difficulty in finding a bed in hogsmeade seamus told harry and ron for wizards and witches were pouring into the village preparing to pay their last respects to dumbledore. some excitement was caused among the younger students who had never seen it before when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest. harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting hagrid’s arms. meanwhile a delegation of ministry officials including the minister of magic himself was being accommodated within the castle. harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them he was sure that sooner or later he would be asked again to account for dumbledore’s last excursion from hogwarts. harry ron hermione and ginny were spending all of their time together. the beautiful weather seemed to mock them harry could imagine how it would have been if dumbledore had not died and they had had this time together at the very end of the year ginny’s examinations finished the pressure of homework lifted . . . and hour by hour he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say doing what he knew was right to do because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort. they visited the hospital wing twice a day neville had been discharged but bill remained under madam pomfrey’s care. his scars were as bad as ever — in truth he now bore a distinct resemblance to mad-eye moody though thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he seemed just the same as ever. all that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks. ... so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said fleur happily plumping up bill’s pillows “because ze british overcook their meat i ’ave always said this.” “i suppose i’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,” sighed ginny later that evening as she harry ron and hermione sat beside the open window of the gryffindor common room looking out over the twilit grounds. “she’s not that bad,” said harry. “ugly though,” he added hastily as ginny raised her eyebrows and she let out a reluctant giggle. “well i suppose if mum can stand it i can.” “anyone else we know died?” ron asked hermione who was perusing the evening prophet. hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “no,” she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper. “they’re still looking for snape but no sign ...” “of course there isn’t,” said harry who became angry every time this subject cropped up. “they won’t find snape till they find voldemort and seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time ...” “i’m going to go to bed,” yawned ginny. “i haven’t been sleeping that well since . . . well ... i could do with some sleep.” she kissed harry ron looked away pointedly waved at the other two and departed for the girls’ dormitories. the moment the door had closed behind her hermione leaned forward toward harry with a most hermione-ish look on her face. “harry i found something out this morning in the library.” “r.a.b.?” said harry sitting up straight. he did not feel the way he had so often felt before excited curious burning to get to the bottom of a mystery he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him the path that he and dumbledore had set out upon together and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. there might still be as many as four horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that voldemort could be killed. he kept reciting their names to himself as though by listing them he could bring them within reach the locket ... the cup . . . the snake . . . something of gryffindor’s or ravenclaw’s . . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of gryffindor’s or ravenclaw’s ... this mantra seemed to pulse through harry’s mind as he fell asleep at night and his dreams were thick with cups lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach though dumbledore helpfully offered harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb. ... he had shown hermione the note inside the locket the morning after dumbledore ’s death and although she had not immediately recognized the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do. “no,” she said sadly “i’ve been trying harry but i haven’t found anything. ... there are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials — rosalind antigone bungs . . . rupert ‘axebanger’ brookstanton ... but they don’t seem to fit at all. judging by that note the person who stole the horcrux knew voldemort and i can’t find a shred of evidence that bungs or axebanger ever had anything to do with him. ... no actually it’s about ... well snape.” she looked nervous even saying the name again. “what about him?” asked harry heavily slumping back in his chair. “well it’s just that i was sort of right about the half blood prince business,” she said tentatively. “d’you have to rub it in hermione how d’you think i feel about that now?” “no — no — harry i didn’t mean that!” she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard. “it’s just that i was right about eileen prince once owning the book. you see ... she was snape ’s mother!” “i thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said ron. hermione ignored him. “i was going through the rest of the old prophets and there was a tiny announcement about eileen prince marrying a man called tobias snape and then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a “ — murderer,” spat harry. “well ... yes,” said hermione. “so ... i was sort of right. snape must have been proud of being ‘half a prince,’ you see tobias snape was a muggle from what it said in the prophet” “yeah that fits,” said harry. “he’d play up the pure blood side so he could get in with lucius malfoy and the rest of them. ... he’s just like voldemort. pure blood mother muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage trying to make himself feared using the dark arts gave himself an impressive new name — lord voldemort — the half-blood prince — how could dumbledore have missed — ” he broke off looking out the window. he could not stop himself dwelling upon dumbledore ’s inexcusable trust in snape ... but as hermione had just inadvertently reminded him he harry had been taken in just the same. ... in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever who had helped him so much. ... helped him ... it was an almost unendurable thought now. “i still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,” said ron. “he must’ve known where you were getting it all from.” “he knew,” said harry bitterly. “he knew when i used sectumsempra. he didn’t really need legilimency. ... he might even have known before then with slughorn talking about how brilliant i was at potions. ... shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard should he?” “but why didn’t he turn you in?” “i don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book,” said hermione. “i don’t think dumbledore would have liked it very much if he’d known. and even if snape pretended it hadn’t been his slughorn would have recognized his writing at once. anyway the book was left in snape’s old classroom and i’ll bet dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘prince.’ ” “i should’ve shown the book to dumbledore,” said harry. “all that time he was showing me how voldemort was evil even when he was at school and i had proof snape was too — ” “ ‘evil’ is a strong word,” said hermione quietly. “you were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!” “i’m trying to say harry that you’re putting too much blame on yourself. i thought the prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor but i would never have guessed he was a potential killer. ...” “none of us could’ve guessed snape would ... you know,” said ron. silence fell between them each of them lost in their own thoughts but harry was sure that they like him were thinking about the following morning when dumbledore’s body would be laid to rest. he had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when sirius had died. he did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see about how he would feel. he wondered whether dumbledore’s death would be more real to him once it was over. though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretches of numbness where despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that dumbledore had really gone. admittedly he had not as he had with sirius looked desperately for some kind of loophole some way that dumbledore would come back. . . . he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake horcrux which he now carried with him everywhere not as a talisman but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do. harry rose early to pack the next day the hogwarts express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. downstairs he found the mood in the great hall subdued. everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. professor mcgonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. hagrid’s chair was deserted too harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast but snape’s place had been unceremoniously filled by rufus scrimgeour. harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the hall harry had the uncomfortable feeling that scrimgeour was looking for him. among scrimgeour’s entourage harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of percy weasley. ron gave no sign that he was aware of percy apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom. over at the slytherin table crabbe and goyle were muttering together. hulking boys though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of malfoy between them bossing them around. harry had not spared malfoy much thought. his animosity was all for snape but he had not forgotten the fear in malfoy’s voice on that tower top nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other death eaters arrived. harry did not believe that malfoy would have killed dumbledore. he despised malfoy still for his infatuation with the dark arts but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike. where harry wondered was malfoy now and what was voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents harry’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from ginny. professor mcgonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the hall died away at once. “it is nearly time,” she said. “please follow your heads of houses out into the grounds. gryffindors after me.” they filed out from behind their benches in near silence. harry glimpsed slughorn at the head of the slytherin column wearing magnificent long emerald green robes embroidered with silver. he had never seen professor sprout head of the hufflepuffs looking so clean there was not a single patch on her hat and when they reached the entrance hall they found madam pince standing beside filch she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs. they were heading as harry saw when he stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors toward the lake. the warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed professor mcgonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. an aisle ran down the center of them there was a marble table standing at the front all chairs facing it. it was the most beautiful summer’s day. an extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs shabby and smart old and young. most harry did not recognize but a few he did including members of the order of the phoenix kingsley shacklebolt mad-eye moody tonks her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink remus lupin with whom she seemed to be holding hands mr. and mrs. weasley bill supported by fleur and followed by fred and george who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. then there was madame maxime who took up two and a half chairs on her own tom the landlord of the leaky cauldron in london arabella figg harry’s squib neighbor the hairy bass player from the wizarding group the weird sisters ernie prang driver of the knight bus madam malkin of the robe shop in diagon alley and some people whom harry merely knew by sight such as the barman of the hog’s head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the hogwarts express. the castle ghosts were there too barely visible in the bright sunlight discernible only when they moved shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air. harry ron hermione and ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. people were whispering to each other it sounded like a breeze in the grass but the birdsong was louder by far. the crowd continued to swell with a great rush of affection for both of them harry saw neville being helped into a seat by luna. neville and luna alone of the d.a. had responded to hermione ’s summons the night that dumbledore had died and harry knew why they were the ones who had missed the d.a. most . . . probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting. cornelius fudge walked past toward the front rows his expression miserable twirling his green bowler hat as usual harry next recognized rita skeeter who he was infuriated to see had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand and then with a worse jolt of fury dolores umbridge an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls. at the sight of the centaur firenze who was standing like a sentinel near the water’s edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away. the staff was seated at last. harry could see scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with professor mcgonagall. he wondered whether scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that dumbledore was dead. but then he heard music strange otherworldly music and he forgot his dislike of the ministry in looking around for the source of it. he was not the only one many heads were turning searching a little alarmed. “in there,” whispered ginny in harry’s ear. and he saw them in the clear green sunlit water inches below the surface reminding him horribly of the inferi a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand their pallid faces rippling their purplish hair flowing all around them. the music made the hair on harry’s neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. it spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. as he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they at least were sorry for dumbledore’s passing. then ginny nudged him again and he looked around. hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. he was crying quite silently his face gleaming with tears and in his arms wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars was what harry knew to be dumbledore’s body. a sharp pain rose in harry’s throat at this sight for a moment the strange music and the knowledge that dumbledore’s body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. ron looked white and shocked. tears were falling thick and fast into both ginny ’s and hermione’s laps. they could not see clearly what was happening at the front. hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. now he retreated down the aisle blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalized looks from some including harry saw dolores umbridge ... but harry knew that dumbledore would not have cared. he tried to make a friendly gesture to hagrid as he passed but hagrid’s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. harry glanced at the back row to which hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him for there dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee was the giant grawp his great ugly boulderlike head bowed docile almost human. hagrid sat down next to his half-brother and grawp patted hagrid hard on the head so that his chair legs sank into the ground. harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. but then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again. a little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of dumbledore ’s body. harry could not hear what he was saying. odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of heads. “nobility of spirit” ... “intellectual contribution” ... “greatness of heart” ... it did not mean very much. it had little to do with dumbledore as harry had known him. he suddenly remembered dumbledore ’s idea of a few words “nitwit,” “oddment,” “blubber,” and “tweak,” and again had to suppress a grin. ... what was the matter with him there was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too. he remembered dumbledore crouching at the water’s edge two years ago very close to where harry now sat and conversing in mermish with the merchieftainess. harry wondered where dumbledore had learned mermish. there was so much he had never asked him so much he should have said. ... and then without warning it swept over him the dreadful truth more completely and undeniably than it had until now. dumbledore was dead gone. ... he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes he looked away from ginny and the others and stared out over the lake toward the forest as the little man in black droned on. ... there was movement among the trees. the centaurs had come to pay their respects too. they did not move into the open but harry saw them standing quite still half hidden in shadow watching the wizards their bows hanging at their sides. and harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then voldemort and how he had faced him and how he and dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. it was important dumbledore said to fight and fight again and keep fighting for only then could evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated. ... and harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally dumbledore all determined to protect him but now that was over. he could not let anybody else stand between him and voldemort he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one that the shelter of a parent’s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. there was no waking from his nightmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really that it was all in his imagination the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before. the little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet he expected speeches probably from the minister but nobody moved. then several people screamed. bright white flames had erupted around dumbledore’s body and the table upon which it lay higher and higher they rose obscuring the body. white smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes harry thought for one heart stopping moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished. in its place was a white marble tomb encasing dumbledore’s body and the table on which he had rested. there were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air but they fell far short of the crowd. it was harry knew the centaurs’ tribute he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view. harry looked at ginny ron and hermione ron’s face was screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him. hermione ’s face was glazed with tears but ginny was no longer crying. she met harry’s gaze with the same hard blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the quidditch cup in his absence and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly and that when he told her what he was going to do now she would not say “be careful,” or “don’t do it,” but accept his decision because she would not have expected anything less of him. and so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since dumbledore had died. “ginny listen ...” he said very quietly as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet “i can’t be involved with you anymore. we’ve got to stop seeing each other. we can’t be together.” she said with an oddly twisted smile “it’s for some stupid noble reason isn’t it?” “it’s been like ... like something out of someone else’s life these last few weeks with you,” said harry. “but i can’t ... we can’t ... i’ve got things to do alone now.” she did not cry she simply looked at him. “voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. he’s already used you as bait once and that was just because you’re my best friend’s sister. think how much danger you’ll be in if we keep this up. he’ll know hell find out. he’ll try and get to me through you.” “what if i don’t care?” said ginny fiercely. “i care,” said harry. “how do you think i’d feel if this was your funeral ... and it was my fault. ...” she looked away from him over the lake. “i never really gave up on you,” she said. “not really. i always hoped. ... hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because i never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember and she thought you might take a bit more notice if i was a bit more — myself.” “smart girl that hermione,” said harry trying to smile. “i just wish i’d asked you sooner. we could’ve had ages ... months ... years maybe. ...” “but you’ve been too busy saving the wizarding world,” said ginny half laughing. “well ... i can’t say i’m surprised. i knew this would happen in the end. i knew you wouldn’t be happy unless you were hunting voldemort. maybe that’s why i like you so much.” harry could not bear to hear these things nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. ron he saw was now holding hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. with a miserable gesture harry got up turned his back on ginny and on dumbledore’s tomb and walked away around the lake. moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the horcruxes and kill voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it. ... “harry!” he turned. rufus scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him around the bank leaning on his walking stick. “i’ve been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if i walk a little way with you?” “no,” said harry indifferently and set off again. “harry this was a dreadful tragedy,” said scrimgeour quietly. “i cannot tell you how appalled i was to hear of it. dumbledore was a very great wizard. we had our disagreements as you know but no one knows better than i — ” “what do you want?” asked harry flatly. scrimgeour looked annoyed but as before hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding. “you are of course devastated,” he said. “i know that you were very close to dumbledore. i think you may have been his favorite pupil ever. the bond between the two of you — ” “what do you want?” harry repeated coming to a halt. scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at harry his expression shrewd now. “the word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.” “whose word?” said harry. “somebody stupefied a death eater on top of the tower after dumbledore died. there were also two broomsticks up there. the ministry can add two and two harry.” “glad to hear it,” said harry. “well where i went with dumbledore and what we did is my business. he didn’t want people to know.” “such loyalty is admirable of course,” said scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty “but dumbledore is gone harry. he’s gone.” “he will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,” said harry smiling in spite of himself. “my dear boy . . . even dumbledore cannot return from the — ” “i am not saying he can. you wouldn’t understand. but i’ve got nothing to tell you.” scrimgeour hesitated then said in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy “the ministry can offer you all sorts of protection you know harry. i would be delighted to place a couple of my aurors at your service — ” harry laughed. “voldemort wants to kill me himself and aurors won’t stop him. so thanks for the offer but no thanks.” “so,” said scrimgeour his voice cold now “the request i made of you at christmas — ” “what request oh yeah . . . the one where i tell the world what a great job you’re doing in exchange for — ” “ — for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped scrimgeour. harry considered him for a moment. “released stan shunpike yet?” scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of uncle vernon. “i see you are — ” “dumbledore’s man through and through,” said harry. “that’s right.” scrimgeour glared at him for another moment then turned and limped away without another word. harry could see percy and the rest of the ministry delegation waiting for him casting nervous glances at the sobbing hagrid and grawp who were still in their seats. ron and hermione were hurrying toward harry passing scrimgeour going in the opposite direction. harry turned and walked slowly on waiting for them to catch up which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times. “what did scrimgeour want?” hermione whispered. “same as he wanted at christmas,” shrugged harry. “wanted me to give him inside information on dumbledore and be the ministry’s new poster boy.” ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment then he said loudly to hermione “look let me go back and hit percy!” “no,” she said firmly grabbing his arm. “it’ll make me feel better!” harry laughed. even hermione grinned a little though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle. “i can’t bear the idea that we might never come back,” she said softly. “how can hogwarts close?” “maybe it won’t,” said ron. “we’re not in any more danger here than we are at home are we everywhere’s the same now. i’d even say hogwarts is safer there are more wizards inside to defend the place. what d’you reckon harry?” “i’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said harry. ron gaped at him but hermione said sadly “i knew you were going to say that. but then what will you do?” ‘tm going back to the dursleys’ once more because dumbledore wanted me to,” said harry. “but it’ll be a short visit and then i’ll be gone for good.” “but where will you go if you don’t come back to school?” “i thought i might go back to godric’s hollow,” harry muttered. he had had the idea in his head ever since the night of dumbledore’s death. “for me it started there all of it. i’ve just got a feeling i need to go there. and i can visit my parents’ graves i’d like that.” “and then what?” said ron. “then i’ve got to track down the rest of the horcruxes haven’t i?” said harry his eyes upon dumbledore’s white tomb reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. “that’s what he wanted me to do that’s why he told me all about them. if dumbledore was right — and i’m sure he was — there are still four of them out there. i’ve got to find them and destroy them and then i’ve got to go after the seventh bit of voldemort’s soul the bit that’s still in his body and i’m the one who’s going to kill him. and if i meet severus snape along the way,” he added “so much the better for me so much the worse for him.” there was a long silence. the crowd had almost dispersed now the stragglers giving the monumental figure of grawp a wide berth as he cuddled hagrid whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water. “well be there harry,” said ron. “what?” “at your aunt and uncle’s house,” said ron. “and then well go with you wherever you’re going.” “no — ” said harry quickly he had not counted on this he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone. “you said to us once before,” said hermione quietly “that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. we’ve had time haven’t we “we’re with you whatever happens,” said ron. “but mate you’re going to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else even godric’s hollow.” “why?” “bill and fleur’s wedding remember?” harry looked at him startled the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful. “yeah we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally. his hand closed automatically around the fake horcrux but in spite of everything in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come whether in a month in a year or in ten he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione. i  the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane. for a second they stood quite still wands directed at each other’s chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction. “news?” asked the taller of the two. “the best,” replied severus snape. the lane was bordered on the left by wild low growing brambles on the right by a high neatly manicured hedge. the men’s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched. “thought i might be late,” said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. “it was a little trickier than i expected. but i hope he will be satisfied. you sound confident that your reception will be good?” snape nodded but did not elaborate. they turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane. the high hedge curved with them running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men’s way. neither of them broke step in silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal were smoke. the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. there was a rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion’s head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge. “he always did himself well lucius. peacocks ...” yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort. a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows. somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it. the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. the eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed snape and yaxley as they strode past. the two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle. the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table. the room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. snape and yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. as their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope and reflected in the mirror and in the bare polished surface of the table below. none of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so. “yaxley. snape,” said a high clear voice from the head of the table. “you are very nearly late.” the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. he was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow. “severus here,” said voldemort indicating the seat on his immediate right. “yaxley — beside dolohov.” the two men took their allotted places. most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first. “so?” “my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall.” the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort. “saturday ... at nightfall,” repeated voldemort. his red eyes fastened upon snape ’s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. snape however looked calmly back into voldemort’s face and after a moment or two voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile. “good. very good. and this information comes — ” “ — from the source we discussed,” said snape. “my lord.” yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape. all faces turned to him. “my lord i have heard differently.” yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on “dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen.” snape was smiling. “my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it. no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish. it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible.” “i assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain,” said yaxley. “if he has been confunded naturally he is certain,” said snape. “i assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter. the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry.” “the order’s got one thing right then eh?” said a squat man sitting a short distance from yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table. voldemort did not laugh. his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought. “my lord,” yaxley went on “dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy voldemort held up a large white hand and yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape. “where are they going to hide the boy next?” “at the home of one of the order,” said snape. “the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide. i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.” “well yaxley?” voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. “will the ministry have fallen by next saturday?” once again all heads turned. yaxley squared his shoulders. “my lord i have good news on that score. i have — with difficulty and after great effort — suceeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse.” many of those sitting around yaxley looked impressed his neighbor dolohov a man with a long twisted face clapped him on the back. “it is a start,” said voldemort. “but thicknesse is only one man. scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before i act. one failed attempt on the minister’s life will set me back a long way.” “yes — my lord that is true — but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments. it will i think be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down.” “as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,” said voldemort. “at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday. if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels.” “we are at an advantage there my lord,” said yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. “we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport. if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately.” “he will not do either,” said snape. “the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place.” “all the better,” said voldemort. “he will have to move in the open. easier to take by far.” again voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on “i shall attend to the boy in person. there have been too many mistakes where harry potter is concerned. some of them have been my own. that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.” the company around the table watched voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for harry potter’s continued existence. voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him. “i have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans. but i know better now. i understand those things that i did not understand before. i must be the one to kill harry potter and i shall be.” at these words seemingly in response to them a sudden wail sounded a terrible drawn-out cry of misery and pain. many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet. “wormtail,” said voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above “have i not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?” “yes m-my lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared at first glance to be unoccupied. now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver. “as i was saying,” continued voldemort looking again at the tense faces of his followers “i understand better now. i shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before i go to kill potter.” the faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms. “no volunteers?” said voldemort. “let’s see ... lucius i see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.” lucius malfoy looked up. his skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. when he spoke his voice was hoarse. “my lord?” “your wand lucius. i require your wand.” malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. she was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. at her touch malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew a wand and passed it along to voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely. “what is it?” “elm my lord,” whispered malfoy. “and the core?” “dragon — dragon heartstring.” “good,” said voldemort. he drew out his own wand and compared the lengths. lucius malfoy made an involuntary movement for a fraction of a second it seemed he expected to receive voldemort’s wand in exchange for his own. the gesture was not missed by voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously. “give you my wand lucius my wand?” some of the throng sniggered. “i have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you but i have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late. ... what is it about my presence in your home that displeases you lucius?” “nothing — nothing my lord!” “such lies lucius ...” the soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. one or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table. the huge snake emerged to climb slowly up voldemort’s chair. it rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across voldemort’s shoulders its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking. voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers still looking at lucius malfoy. “why do the malfoys look so unhappy with their lot is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?” “of course my lord,” said lucius malfoy. his hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “we did desire it — we do.” to malfoy’s left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from voldemort and the snake. to his right his son draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact. “my lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion “it is an honor to have you here in our family’s house. there can be no higher pleasure.” she sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where narcissa sat rigid and impassive bellatrix leaned toward voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness. “no higher pleasure,” repeated voldemort his head tilted a little to one side as he considered bellatrix. “that means a great deal bellatrix from you.” her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight. “my lord knows i speak nothing but the truth!” “no higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy event that i hear has taken place in your family this week?” she stared at him her lips parted evidently confused. “i don’t know what you mean my lord.” “i’m talking about your niece bellatrix. and yours lucius and narcissa. she has just married the werewolf remus lupin. you must be so proud.” there was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks a few thumped the table with their fists. the great snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the death eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at bellatrix and the malfoys’ humiliation. bellatrix’s face so recently flushed with happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red. “she is no niece of ours my lord,” she cried over the outpouring of mirth. “we — narcissa and i — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood. this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries.” “what say you draco?” asked voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “will you babysit the cubs?” the hilarity mounted draco malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mother’s eye. she shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall. “enough,” said voldemort stroking the angry snake. “enough.” and the laughter died at once. “many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,” he said as bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring. “you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.” “yes my lord,” whispered bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. “at the first chance!” “you shall have it,” said voldemort. “and in your family so in the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain. ...” voldemort raised lucius malfoy’s wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick. the figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds. “do you recognize our guest severus?” asked voldemort. snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. all of the death eaters were looking up at the captive now as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. as she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice “severus! help me!” “ah yes,” said snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. “and you draco?” asked voldemort stroking the snake’s snout with his wand-free hand. draco shook his head jerkily. now that the woman had woken he seemed unable to look at her anymore. “but you would not have taken her classes,” said voldemort. “for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.” there were small noises of comprehension around the table. a broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled. “yes . . . professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles . . . how they are not so different from us ...” one of the death eaters spat on the floor. charity burbage revolved to face snape again. “severus ... please ... please ...” “silence,” said voldemort with another twitch of malfoy’s wand and charity fell silent as if gagged. “not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the daily prophet wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. the dwindling of the purebloods is says professor burbage a most desirable circumstance. ... she would have us all mate with muggles ... or no doubt werewolves. ...” nobody laughed this time there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in voldemort’s voice. for the third time charity burbage revolved to face snape. tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again. “avada kedavra.” the flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. charity fell with a resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked. several of the death eaters leapt back in their chairs. draco fell out of his onto the floor. “dinner nagini,” said voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood. in memoriam harry was bleeding. clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door. there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door. “what the — ” he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted. possibly the cup of tea was dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap. keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap. it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it — particularly in light of his immediate plans — this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him. harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom — old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit. minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. he now proceeded a little more cautiously. kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks  a cracked and worn-out sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed r.a.b. had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. he recognized it at once. it was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him. harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit. harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind. he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. his muggle clothing invisibility cloak potion-making kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. in a front pocket were the marauder’s map and the locket with the note signed r.a.b. inside it. the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable — in all usual senses it was worthless — but because of what it had cost to attain it. this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer. he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk. hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one. the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment. as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts. at last he found it. turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for. albus dumbledore remembered by elphias doge i met albus dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwarts. our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. i had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while i was no longer contagious my pockmarked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. for his part albus had arrived at hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. scarcely a year previously his father percival had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young muggles. albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when i plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. beyond that dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so. some indeed were disposed to praise his father’s action and assumed that albus too was a muggle hater. they could not have been more mistaken as anybody who knew albus would attest he never revealed the remotest anti-muggle tendency. indeed his determined support for muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years. in a matter of months however albus’s own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. by the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a muggle-hater but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous. he confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching. he not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including nicolas flamel the celebrated alchemist  bathilda bagshot the noted historian and adalbert waffling the magical theoretician. several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as transfiguration today challenges in charming and the practical potioneer. dumbledore’s future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become minister of magic. though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had ministerial ambitions. three years after we had started at hogwarts albus’s brother aberforth arrived at school. they were not alike aberforth was never bookish and unlike albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. however it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends. they rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. in fairness to aberforth it must be admitted that living in albus’s shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. when albus and i left hogwarts we intended to take the then traditional tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers. however tragedy intervened. on the very eve of our trip albus’s mother kendra died leaving albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family. i postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at kendra’s funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. with a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of albus accompanying me. that was the period of our lives when we had least contact. i wrote to albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in greece to the experiments of the egyptian alchemists. his letters told me little of his day-to-day life which i guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that i heard toward the end of my year’s travels that yet another tragedy had struck the dumbledores the death of his sister ariana. though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers. all those closest to albus — and i count myself one of that lucky number — agree that ariana ’s death and albus’s feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore. i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person’s suffering. albus was more reserved than before and much less light hearted. to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement. in time this would lift — in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one. however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them. other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. dumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while chief warlock of the wizengamot. they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in 1 945. those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. dumbledore’s triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of he who-must-not-be-named. albus dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and i believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. i shall miss his friendship more than i can say but my loss is as nothing compared to the wizarding world’s. that he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. he died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that i met him. harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of x-raying harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. he had thought he knew dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. never once had he imagined dumbledore ’s childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as harry had known him venerable and silver-haired and old. the idea of a teenage dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid hermione or a friendly blast-ended skrewt. he had never thought to ask dumbledore about his past. no doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with grindelwald and harry had not thought to ask dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements. no they had always discussed harry harry’s past harry’s future harry’s plans ... and it seemed to harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that dumbledore had not answered honestly “ what do you see when you look in the mirror?” “  i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks.” after several minutes’ thought harry tore the obituary out of the prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts. then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. it was much tidier. the only things left out of place were today’s daily prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror. harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off today’s prophet and unfolded the newspaper. he had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about voldemort. harry was sure that the ministry was leaning on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort. it was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed. across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of dumbledore striding along looking harried dumbledore — the truth at last coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. stripping away the popular image of serene silver-bearded wisdom rita skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the lifelong feuds and the guilty secrets that dumbledore carried to his grave. why was the man tipped to be minister of magic content to remain a mere headmaster what was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledore really meet his end the answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography the life and lies of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter exclusively interviewed by betty braithwaite page 13 inside. harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. the article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile wiggling her fingers up at him. doing his best to ignore this nauseating image harry read on. in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip. “well of course dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” says skeeter. “such a long full life. i’m sure my book will be the first of very very many.” skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. her nine hundred-page book was completed a mere four weeks after dumbledore ’s mysterious death in june. i ask her how she managed this superfast feat. “oh when you’ve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature. i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need.” i mention the recent widely publicized remarks of elphias doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstanding friend of albus dumbledore’s that “skeeter’s book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card. ” skeeter throws back her head and laughs. “darling dodgy! i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him. completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout.” and yet elphias doge’s accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. does skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of dumbledore’s long and extraordinary life “oh my dear,” beams skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles “you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’ and a nice sharp quick-quotes quill! people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway. not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know — he trod on an awful lot of important toes. but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because i’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.” the advance publicity for skeeter’ s biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe dumbledore to have led a blameless life. what were the biggest surprises she uncovered i ask “now come off it betty i’m not giving away all the highlights before anybody’s bought the book!” laughs skeeter. “but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! let’s just say that nobody hearing him rage against you-know-who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth! and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasn’t exactly broad-minded when he was younger! yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.” i ask whether skeeter is referring to dumbledore ’s brother aberforth whose conviction by the wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. “oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap ” laughs skeeter. “no no i’m talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the muggle-maiming father — dumbledore couldn’t keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot. no it’s the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness — but as i say you’ll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. all i can say now is it’s no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken. ” family skeletons notwithstanding does skeeter deny the brilliance that led to dumbledore ’s many magical discoveries “he had brains,” she concedes “although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.” but the importance of some of dumbledore’s achievements cannot i venture be denied. what of his famous defeat of grindelwald “oh now i’m glad you mentioned grindelwald,” says skeeter with a tantalizing smile. “i’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over dumbledore’s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell — or perhaps a dungbomb. very dirty business indeed. all i’ll say is don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend. after they’ve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!” skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other. “oh yes,” says skeeter nodding briskly “i devote an entire chapter to the whole potter-dumbledore relationship. it’s been called unhealthy even sinister. again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go. whether that was really in the boy’s best interests — well we’ll see. it’s certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence.” i ask whether skeeter is still in touch with harry potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that you-know-who had returned. “oh yes we’ve developed a close bond,” says skeeter. “poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life — the triwizard tournament. i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter.” which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about dumbledore’s final hours. does skeeter believe that potter was there when dumbledore died “well i don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed. potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide — once they’ve read my book.” on that intriguing note i take my leave. there can be no doubt that skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. dumbledore’s legions of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero. harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page. revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin. he began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from rita’s article echoed in his head an entire chapter to the whole potter-dumbledore relationship . . . it’s been called unhealthy even sinister. . . . he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth . . . i’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for ... “lies!” harry bellowed and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously. harry sat down hard on the bed. the broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him. ... a flash of brightest blue. harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. he had imagined it he must have done. he glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunia’s choosing there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect. he peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him. he had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. if anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again. 3 the dursleys departing the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice yelled “oi! you!” sixteen years of being addressed thus left harry in no doubt whom his uncle was calling nevertheless he did not immediately respond. he was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which for a split second he had thought he saw dumbledore’s eye. it was not until his uncle bellowed “boy!” that harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him. “you took your time!” roared vernon dursley when harry appeared at the top of the stairs. “get down here i want a word!” harry strolled downstairs his hands deep in his jeans pockets. when he reached the living room he found all three dursleys. they were dressed for traveling uncle vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket aunt petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat and dudley harry’s large blond muscular cousin in his leather jacket. “yes?” asked harry. “sit down!” said uncle vernon. harry raised his eyebrows. “please!” added uncle vernon wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. harry sat. he thought he knew what was coming. his uncle began to pace up and down aunt petunia and dudley following his movements with anxious expressions. finally his large purple face crumpled with concentration uncle vernon stopped in front of harry and spoke. “i’ve changed my mind,” he said. “what a surprise,” said harry. “don’t you take that tone — ” began aunt petunia in a shrill voice but vernon dursley waved her down. “it’s all a lot of claptrap,” said uncle vernon glaring at harry with piggy little eyes. “i’ve decided i don’t believe a word of it. we’re staying put we’re not going anywhere.” harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. vernon dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for the past four weeks packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. harry’s favorite moment had been the one when uncle vernon unaware that dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing. “according to you,” vernon dursley said now resuming his pacing up and down the living room “we — petunia dudley and i — are in danger. from — from — ” “some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said harry. “well i don’t believe it,” repeated uncle vernon coming to a halt in front of harry again. “i was awake half the night thinking it all over and i believe it’s a plot to get the house.” “the house?” repeated harry. “what house?” “ this house!” shrieked uncle vernon the vein in his forehead starting to pulse. “our house! house prices are skyrocketing around here! you want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and — ” “are you out of your mind?” demanded harry. “a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look?” “don’t you dare — !” squealed aunt petunia but again vernon waved her down slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted. “just in case you’ve forgotten,” said harry “i’ve already got a house my godfather left me one. so why would i want this one all the happy memories?” there was silence. harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument. “you claim,” said uncle vernon starting to pace yet again “that this lord thing — ” “ — voldemort,” said harry impatiently “and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already. this isn’t a claim it’s fact dumbledore told you last year and kingsley and mr. weasley — ” vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into harry’s summer holidays of two fully grown wizards. the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys. harry had to admit however that as mr. weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon. “ — kingsley and mr. weasley explained it all as well,” harry pressed on remorselessly. “once i’m seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me. the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage i’d come and try to rescue you.” uncle vernon’s and harry’s eyes met. harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed “you’ve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help. you’re being offered serious protection the best there is.” uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down. outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. the next-door neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again. “i thought there was a ministry of magic?” asked vernon dursley abruptly. “there is,” said harry surprised. “well then why can’t they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection!” harry laughed he could not help himself. it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. “you heard what mr. weasley and kingsley said,” harry replied. “we think the ministry has been infiltrated.” uncle vernon strode to the fireplace and back breathing so heavily that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration. “all right,” he said stopping in front of harry yet again. “all right let’s say for the sake of argument we accept this protection. i still don’t see why we can’t have that kingsley bloke.” harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty. this question had also been addressed half a dozen times. “as i’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth “kingsley is protecting the mug — i mean your prime minister.” “exactly — he’s the best!” said uncle vernon pointing at the blank television screen. the dursleys had spotted kingsley on the news walking along discreetly behind the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital. this and the fact that kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow deep voice had caused the dursleys to take to kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in. “well he’s taken,” said harry. “but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job — ” “if we’d even seen cvs ...” began uncle vernon but harry lost patience. getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle now pointing at the tv set himself. “these accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. people are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it — voldemort. i’ve told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun. even the fogs — they’re caused by dementors and if you can’t remember what they are ask your son!” dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. with his parents’ and harry’s eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked “there are . . . more of them?” “more?” laughed harry. “more than the two that attacked us you mean of course there are there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair — ” “all right all right,” blustered vernon dursley. “you’ve made your point — ” “i hope so,” said harry “because once i’m seventeen all of them — death eaters dementors maybe even inferi — which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard — will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think you 11 agree you need help.” there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon dudley was staring at harry. finally uncle vernon blurted out “but what about my work what about dudley’s school i don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards — ” “don’t you understand?” shouted harry. “they will torture and kill you like they did my parents !” “dad,” said dudley in a loud voice “dad — i’m going with these order people.” “dudley,” said harry “for the first time in your life you’re talking sense.” he knew that the battle was won. if dudley was frightened enough to accept the order’s help his parents would accompany him there could be no question of being separated from their diddykins. harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. “they’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said and when none of the dursleys replied he left the room. the prospect of parting — probably forever — from his aunt uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. what did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike back in his bedroom harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of hedwig’s cage. they fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them. “we’re leaving soon really soon,” harry told her. “and then you’ll be able to fly again.” the doorbell rang. harry hesitated then headed back out of his room and downstairs. it was too much to expect hestia and dedalus to cope with the dursleys on their own. “harry potter!” squeaked an excited voice the moment harry had opened the door a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. “an honor as ever!” “thanks dedalus,” said harry bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark-haired hestia. “it’s really good of you to do this. ... they’re through here my aunt and uncle and cousin. ...” “good day to you harry potter’s relatives!” said dedalus happily striding into the living room. the dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus harry half expected another change of mind. dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard. “i see you are packed and ready. excellent! the plan as harry has told you is a simple one,” said dedalus pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “we shall be leaving before harry does. due to the danger of using magic in your house — harry being still underage it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be driving say ten miles or so before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. you know how to drive i take it?” he asked uncle vernon politely. “know how to —  of course i ruddy well know how to drive!” spluttered uncle vernon. “very clever of you sir very clever i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said dedalus. he was clearly under the impression that he was flattering vernon dursley who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word dedalus spoke. “can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath his mustache rippling indignantly but fortunately neither dedalus nor hestia seemed to hear him. “you harry,” dedalus continued “will wait here for your guard. there has been a little change in the arrangements — ” “what d’you mean?” said harry at once. “i thought mad-eye was going to come and take me by side along apparition?” “can’t do it,” said hestia tersely. “mad-eye will explain.” the dursleys who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces jumped as a loud voice screeched “hurry up\” harry looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from dedalus’s pocket watch. “quite right we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said dedalus nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. “we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family’s disapparition harry thus the charm breaks at the moment you all head for safety.” he turned to the dursleys. “well are we all packed and ready to go?” none of them answered him. uncle vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in dedalus’s waistcoat pocket. “perhaps we should wait outside in the hall dedalus,” murmured hestia. she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while harry and the dursleys exchanged loving possibly tearful farewells. “there’s no need,” harry muttered but uncle vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly “well this is good-bye then boy.” he swung his right arm upward to shake harry’s hand but at the last moment seemed unable to face it and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome. “ready diddy?” asked aunt petunia fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at harry altogether. dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar reminding harry a little of the giant grawp. “come along then,” said uncle vernon. he had already reached the living room door when dudley mumbled “i don’t understand.” “what don’t you understand popkin?” asked aunt petunia looking up at her son. dudley raised a large hamlike hand to point at harry. “why isn’t he coming with us?” uncle vernon and aunt petunia froze where they stood staring at dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina. “what?” said uncle vernon loudly. “why isn’t he coming too?” asked dudley. “well he — he doesn’t want to,” said uncle vernon turning to glare at harry and adding “you don’t want to do you?” “not in the slightest,” said harry. “there you are,” uncle vernon told dudley. “now come on we’re off.” he marched out of the room. they heard the front door open but dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps aunt petunia stopped too. “what now?” barked uncle vernon reappearing in the doorway. it seemed that dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. after several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said “but where’s he going to go?” aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked at each other. it was clear that dudley was frightening them. hestia jones broke the silence. “but . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she asked looking bewildered. “certainly we know,” said vernon dursley. “he’s off with some of your lot isn’t he right dudley let’s get in the car you heard the man we’re in a hurry.” again vernon dursley marched as far as the front door but dudley did not follow. “off with some of our lot?” hestia looked outraged. harry had met this attitude before witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous harry potter. “it’s fine,” harry assured her. “it doesn’t matter honestly.” “doesn’t matter?” repeated hestia her voice rising ominously. “don’t these people realize what you’ve been through what danger you are in the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-voldemort movement?” “er — no they don’t,” said harry. “they think i’m a waste of space actually but i’m used to — ” “i don’t think you’re a waste of space.” if harry had not seen dudley’s lips move he might not have believed it. as it was he stared at dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing dudley had turned red. harry was embarrassed and astonished himself. “well ... er ... thanks dudley.” again dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling “you saved my life.” “not really,” said harry. “it was your soul the dementor would have taken. ...” he looked curiously at his cousin. they had had virtually no contact during this summer or last as harry had come back to privet drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. it now dawned on harry however that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. although rather touched he was nevertheless quite relieved that dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings. after opening his mouth once or twice more dudley subsided into scarlet-faced silence. aunt petunia burst into tears. hestia jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as aunt petunia ran forward and embraced dudley rather than harry. “s-so sweet dudders ...” she sobbed into his massive chest. “s-such a lovely b-boy ... s-saying thank you “but he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said hestia indignantly. “he only said he didn’t think harry was a waste of space!” “yeah but coming from dudley that’s like ‘i love you,’ ” said harry torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as aunt petunia continued to clutch at dudley as if he had just saved harry from a burning building. “are we going or not?” roared uncle vernon reappearing yet again at the living room door. “i thought we were on a tight schedule!” “yes — yes we are,” said dedalus diggle who had been watching these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. “we really must be off. harry — ” he tripped forward and wrung harry’s hand with both of his own. “ — good luck. i hope we meet again. the hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.” “oh,” said harry “right. thanks.” “farewell harry,” said hestia also clasping his hand. “our thoughts go with you.” “i hope everything’s okay,” said harry with a glance toward aunt petunia and dudley. “oh i’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said diggle brightly waving his hat as he left the room. hestia followed him. dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked toward harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. then dudley held out his large pink hand. “blimey dudley,” said harry over aunt petunia’s renewed sobs “did the dementors blow a different personality into you?” “dunno,” muttered dudley. “see you harry.” “yeah ...” said harry taking dudley’s hand and shaking it. “maybe. take care big d.” dudley nearly smiled then lumbered from the room. harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive and then a car door slammed. aunt petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at the sound. she did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with harry. hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said “well — good-bye,” and marched toward the door without looking at him. “good-bye,” said harry. she stopped and looked back. for a moment harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him she gave him an odd tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech but then with a little jerk of her head she bustled out of the room after her husband and son. the seven potters harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the dursleys’ car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. dedalus’s top hat was visible between aunt petunia and dudley in the backseat. the car turned right at the end of privet drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone. harry picked up hedwig’s cage his firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs. the light was fading rapidly now the hall full of shadows in the evening light. it felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. long ago when he had been left alone while the dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on dudley’s computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content. it gave him an odd empty feeling to remember those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost. “don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing. “we’ll never be here again. don’t you want to remember all the good times i mean look at this doormat. what memories ... dudley puked on it after i saved him from the dementors. ... turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it ... and last summer dumbledore walked through that front door. harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing. harry turned his back on the front door. “and under here hedwig” — harry pulled open a door under the stairs — “is where i used to sleep! you never knew me then — blimey it’s small i’d forgotten. ...” harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. but harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once — uncle vernon had nearly crashed the car when harry had recounted it — a flying motorbike . . . there was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby. harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. pausing only to employ a few of uncle vernon’s choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden. the darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering. then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their disillusionment charms lifted. dominating the scene was hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. all around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses. wrenching open the back door harry hurtled into their midst. there was a general cry of greeting as hermione flung her arms around him ron clapped him on the back and hagrid said “all righ’ harry ready fer the off?” “definitely,” said harry beaming around at them all. “but i wasn’t expecting this many of you!” “change of plan,” growled mad-eye who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. “let’s get undercover before we talk you through it.” harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon aunt petunia’s gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances ron long and lanky hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait fred and george grinning identically bill badly scarred and long haired mr. weasley kind-faced balding his spectacles a little awry mad-eye battle-worn one legged his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink lupin grayer more lined fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair kingsley bald black broad-shouldered hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and mundungus fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy basset hound’s eyes and matted hair. harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight he felt incredibly fond of all of them even mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met. “kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister?” he called across the room. “he can get along without me for one night,” said kingsley. “you’re more important.” “harry guess what?” said tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glittered there. “you got married?” harry yelped looking from her to lupin. “i’m sorry you couldn’t be there harry it was very quiet.” “that’s brilliant congrat — ” “all right all right we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later!” roared moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen. moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to harry. “as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a. pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem. he’s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out. all done in the name of your protection to prevent you-know-who getting in at you. absolutely pointless seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. what he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely. “second problem you’re underage which means you’ve still got the trace on you.” “i don’t — ” “the trace the trace!” said mad-eye impatiently. “the charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens the way the ministry finds out about underage magic! if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters. “we can’t wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. in short pius thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and proper.” harry could not help but agree with the unknown thicknesse. “so what are we going to do?” “we’re going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace can’t detect because we don’t need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrid’s motorbike.” harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give mad-eye the chance to address them. “now your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or” — moody gestured around the pristine kitchen — “you no longer call this place home. you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that you’re never going to live together again correct?” harry nodded. “so this time when you leave there’ll be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. we’re choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for you-know-who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. “the one thing we’ve got on our side is that you know-who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. we’ve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. however this is you-know-who we’re dealing with so we can’t just rely on him getting the date wrong he’s bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case. so we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. they all look like they could be the place we’re going to hide you they’ve all got some connection with the order my house kingsley’s place molly’s auntie muriel’s — you get the idea.” “yeah,” said harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. “you’ll be going to tonks’s parents. once you’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house you’ll be able to use a portkey to the burrow. any questions?” “er — yes,” said harry. “maybe they won’t know which of the twelve secure houses i’m heading for at first but won’t it be sort of obvious once” — he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off toward tonks’s parents’?” “ah,” said moody “i forgot to mention the key point. fourteen of us won’t be flying to tonks’s parents’. there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house.” from inside his cloak moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. there was no need for him to say another word harry understood the rest of the plan immediately. “no!” he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen. “no way!” “i told them you’d take it like this,” said hermione with a hint of complacency. “if you think i’m going to let six people risk their lives — !” “ — because it’s the first time for all of us,” said ron. “this is different pretending to be me — ” “well none of us really fancy it harry,” said fred earnestly. “imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever.” harry did not smile. “you can’t do it if i don’t cooperate you need me to give you some hair.” “well that’s that plan scuppered,” said george. “obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.” “yeah thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic we’ve got no chance,” said fred. “funny,” said harry “really amusing.” “if it has to come to force then it will,” growled moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at harry. “everyone here’s overage potter and they’re all prepared to take the risk.” mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of moody’s head. “let’s have no more arguments. time’s wearing on. i want a few of your hairs boy now.” “but this is mad there’s no need — ” “no need!” snarled moody. “with you-know-who out there and half the ministry on his side potter if we’re lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but he’d be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out it’s what i’d do. they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the place. our only chance is to use decoys. even you-know-who can’t split himself into seven.” harry caught hermione’s eye and looked away at once. “so potter — some of your hair if you please.” harry glanced at ron who grimaced at him in a just do-it sort of way. “now!” barked moody. with all of their eyes upon him harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled. “good,” said moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. “straight in here if you please.” harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. the moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold. “ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry,” said hermione before catching sight of ron’s raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying “oh you know what i mean — goyle ’s potion looked like bogies.” “right then fake potters line up over here please,” said moody. ron hermione fred george and fleur lined up in front of aunt petunia’s gleaming sink. “we’re one short,” said lupin. “here,” said hagrid gruffly and he lifted mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between fred and george instead. “i’ve toldjer i’d sooner be a protector,” said mundungus. “shut it,” growled moody. “as i’ve already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him. dumbledore always said you-know-who would want to finish potter in person. it’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eaters’ll want to kill them.” mundungus did not look particularly reassured but moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little polyjuice potion into each one. “altogether then ...” ron hermione fred george fleur and mundungus drank. all of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats at once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. hermione and mundungus were shooting upward ron fred and george were shrinking their hair was darkening hermione’s and fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls. moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him. when he straightened up again there were six harry potters gasping and panting in front of him. fred and george turned to each other and said together “wow — we’re identical!” “i dunno though i think i’m still better-looking,” said fred examining his reflection in the kettle. “bah,” said fleur checking herself in the microwave door “bill don’t look at me — i’m ’ideous.” “those whose clothes are a bit roomy i’ve got smaller here,” said moody indicating the first sack “and vice versa. don’t forget the glasses there’s six pairs in the side pocket. and when you’re dressed there’s luggage in the other sack.” the real harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things. he watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away. he felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own. “i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said ron looking down at his bare chest. “harry your eyesight really is awful,” said hermione as she put on glasses. once dressed the fake harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack. “good,” said moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and luggage-laden harrys faced him. “the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom — ” “why’m i with you?” grunted the harry nearest the back door. “because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from mundungus as he continued “arthur and fred — ” “i’m george,” said the twin at whom moody was pointing. “can’t you even tell us apart when we’re harry?” “sorry george — ” “i’m only yanking your wand i’m fred really — ” “enough messing around!” snarled moody. “the other one — george or fred or whoever you are — you’re with remus. miss delacour — ” “i’m taking fleur on a thestral,” said bill. “she’s not that fond of brooms.” fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. “miss granger with kingsley again by thestral — ” hermione looked reassured as she answered kingsley’s smile harry knew that hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick. “which leaves you and me ron!” said tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him. ron did not look quite as pleased as hermione. “an’ you’re with me harry. that all righ’?” said hagrid looking a little anxious. “we’ll be on the bike brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight see. not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it though so you’ll be in the sidecar.” “that’s great,” said harry not altogether truthfully. “we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” said moody who seemed to guess how harry was feeling. “snape’s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters we’re betting they’ll choose one of the potters who look at home on a broomstick. all right then,” he went on tying up the sack with the fake potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to the door “i make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. no point locking the back door it won’t keep the death eaters out when they come looking. ... come on. ...” harry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack firebolt and hedwig’s cage before joining the others in the dark back garden. on every side broomsticks were leaping into hands hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by kingsley fleur onto the other by bill. hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on. “is this it is this sirius’s bike?” “the very same,” said hagrid beaming down at harry. “an’ the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand!” harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. it placed him several feet below everybody else ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed hedwig’s cage between his knees. it was extremely uncomfortable. “arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said hagrid quite oblivious to harry’s discomfort. he settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “it’s got a few tricks up its handlebars now. tha’ one was my idea.” he pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. “please be careful hagrid,” said mr. weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick. “i’m still not sure that was advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.” “all right then,” said moody. “everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion’s lost.” everybody mounted their brooms. “hold tight now ron,” said tonks and harry saw ron throw a furtive guilty look at lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist. hagrid kicked the motorbike into life it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate. “good luck everyone,” shouted moody. “see you all in about an hour at the burrow. on the count of three. one ... two ... three.” there was a great roar from the motorbike and harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch he was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face. around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. his legs jammed into the sidecar by hedwig’s cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb. so great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four privet drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. higher and higher they climbed into the sky — and then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded. at least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the midst of which the order members had risen oblivious — screams a blaze of green light on every side hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. hedwig’s cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees — “no — hedwig!” the broomstick spun to earth but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. a second’s relief and then another burst of green light. the owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. “no — no!” the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle. “hedwig — hedwig — ” but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. he could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount. he glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were — “hagrid we’ve got to go back we’ve got to go back!” he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming hedwig’s cage onto the floor refusing to believe that she was dead. “hagrid turn around!” “my job’s ter get you there safe harry!” bellowed hagrid and he opened the throttle. “stop — stop!” harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear four death eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for hagrid ’s broad back. hagrid swerved but the death eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. wriggling around he cried “stupefy\” and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing death eaters as they scattered to avoid it. “hold on harry this’ll do for ’em!” roared hagrid and harry looked up just in time to see hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. a wall a solid brick wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe. craning his neck harry saw it expand into being in midair. three of the death eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces. one of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. more killing curses flew past harry’s head from the two remaining death eaters’ wands they were aiming for hagrid. harry responded with further stunning spells red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and harry thought wildly of fireworks and the muggles below who would have no idea what was happening — “here we go again harry hold on!” yelled hagrid and he jabbed at a second button. this time a great net burst from the bike’s exhaust but the death eaters were ready for it. not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up. he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it. “this’ll do it harry hold on tight!” yelled hagrid and harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer. with an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust white-hot and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. harry saw the death eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. “it’s all righ’ harry!” bellowed hagrid now thrown flat onto his back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream. ‘tm on it harry don’ worry!” hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella. “hagrid! no! let me!” “reparol” there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bike’s flight then the sidecar began to lose height — in desperation harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted “wingardium leviosal” the sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne he had but a split second’s relief however as more curses streaked past him the three death eaters were closing in. “i’m cornin’ harry!” hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled “impedimental” the jinx hit the middle death eater in the chest for a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier one of his fellows almost collided with him — then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat — “i’m cornin’ harry i’m cornin’!” a huge hand seized the back of harry’s robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself back-to back with hagrid. as they soared upward away from the two remaining death eaters harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled “confringo\” he knew a dreadful gut-wrenching pang for hedwig as it exploded the death eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished. “harry i’m sorry i’m sorry,” moaned hagrid “i shouldn’ta tried ter repair it meself — yeh’ve got no room — ” “it’s not a problem just keep flying!” harry shouted back as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer. as the curses came shooting across the intervening space again hagrid swerved and zigzagged harry knew that hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again with harry seated so insecurely. harry sent stunning spell after stunning spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off. he shot another blocking jinx at them the closest death eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next stunning spell harry saw the strangely blank face of stanley shunpike — stan — “ expelliarmusv’ harry yelled. “that’s him it’s him it’s the real one!” the hooded death eater’s shout reached harry even above the thunder of the motorbike’s engine next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. “harry what’s happened?” bellowed hagrid. “where ve they gone?” “i don’t know!” but harry was afraid the hooded death eater had shouted “it’s the real one!” how had he known he gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. where were they he clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of hagrid ’s jacket. “hagrid do the dragon-fire thing again let’s get out of here!” “hold on tight then harry!” there was a deafening screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust harry felt himself slipping backward off what little of the seat he had hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars — “i think we’ve lost ’em harry i think we’ve done it!” yelled hagrid. but harry was not convinced fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come. ... why had they fallen back one of them had still had a wand. ... it’s him ... it’s the real one. . . . they had said it right after he had tried to disarm stan. ... “we’re nearly there harry we’ve nearly made it!” shouted hagrid. harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars. then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a death eater appeared on either side of the bike two killing curses missed harry by millimeters cast from behind — and then harry saw him. voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again — hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. clinging on for dear life harry sent stunning spells flying at random into the whirling night. he saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control — green jets of light shot past them again. harry had no idea which way was up which down his scar was still burning he expected to die at any second. a hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm — “no!” with a shout of fury hagrid launched himself off the bike at the death eater to his horror harry saw both hagrid and the death eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick — barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees harry heard voldemort scream “mine\” it was over he could not see or hear where voldemort was he glimpsed another death eater swooping out of the way and heard “avada — ” as the pain from harry’s scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord. he felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury. the remaining death eater yelled voldemort screamed “ no somehow harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. he punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground. “hagrid!” harry called holding on to the bike for dear life. “hagrid — accio hagridl” the motorbike sped up sucked toward the earth. face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. behind him came another scream “your wand selwyn give me your wand\” he felt voldemort before he saw him. looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw voldemort preparing to curse him once more — and then voldemort vanished. harry looked down and saw hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. he pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting ground-trembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond. 5 fallen warrior “hagrid?” harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand. he could not understand where voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment. something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead. he crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was hagrid. “hagrid hagrid talk to me — ” but the dark mass did not stir. “who’s there is it potter are you harry potter?” harry did not recognize the man’s voice. then a woman shouted “they’ve crashed ted! crashed in the garden!” harry’s head was swimming. “hagrid,” he repeated stupidly and his knees buckled. the next thing he knew he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. his missing tooth had been regrown. the scar on his forehead was still throbbing. “hagrid?” he opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar lamplit sitting room. his rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away wet and muddy. a fair-haired big-bellied man was watching harry anxiously. “hagrid’s fine son,” said the man “the wife’s seeing to him now. how are you feeling anything else broken i’ve fixed your ribs your tooth and your arm. i’m ted by the way ted tonks — dora’s father.” harry sat up too quickly lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy. “voldemort — ” “easy now,” said ted tonks placing a hand on harry’s shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions. “that was a nasty crash you just had. what happened anyway something go wrong with the bike arthur weasley overstretch himself again him and his muggle contraptions?” “no,” said harry as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “death eaters loads of them — we were chased — ” “death eaters?” said ted sharply. “what d’you mean death eaters i thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight i thought — ” “they knew,” said harry. ted tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above. “well we know our protective charms hold then don’t we they shouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.” now harry understood why voldemort had vanished it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the order’s charms. he only hoped they would continue to work he imagined voldemort a hundred yards above them as they spoke looking for a way to penetrate what harry visualized as a great transparent bubble. he swung his legs off the sofa he needed to see hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. he had barely stood up however when a door opened and hagrid squeezed through it his face covered in mud and blood limping a little but miraculously alive. “harry!” knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. “blimey harry how did yeh get out o’ that i thought we were both goners.” “yeah me too. i can’t believe — ” harry broke off. he had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind hagrid. “you!” he shouted and he thrust his hand into his pocket but it was empty. “your wand’s here son,” said ted tapping it on harry’s arm. “it fell right beside you i picked it up. and that’s my wife you’re shouting at.” “oh i’m — i’m sorry.” as she moved forward into the room mrs. tonks’s resemblance to her sister bellatrix became much less pronounced her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. nevertheless she looked a little haughty after harry’s exclamation. “what happened to our daughter?” she asked. “hagrid said you were ambushed where is nymphadora?” “i don’t know,” said harry. “we don’t know what happened to anyone else.” she and ted exchanged looks. a mixture of fear and guilt gripped harry at the sight of their expressions if any of the others had died it was his fault all his fault. he had consented to the plan given them his hair. ... “the portkey,” he said remembering all of a sudden. “we’ve got to get back to the burrow and find out — then well be able to send you word or — or tonks will once she’s — ” “dora’ll be okay ’dromeda,” said ted. “she knows her stuff she’s been in plenty of tight spots with the aurors. the portkey ’s through here,” he added to harry. “it’s supposed to leave in three minutes if you want to take it.” “yeah we do,” said harry. he seized his rucksack swung it onto his shoulders. “i — ” he looked at mrs. tonks wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and insincere. “ill tell tonks — dora — to send word when she ... thanks for patching us up thanks for everything. i — he was glad to leave the room and follow ted tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. hagrid came after them bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel. “there you go son. that’s the portkey.” mr. tonks was pointing to a small silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing table. “thanks,” said harry reaching out to place a finger on it ready to leave. “wait a moment,” said hagrid looking around. “harry where’s hedwig?” “she ... she got hit,” said harry. the realization crashed over him he felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. the owl had been his companion his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the dursleys. hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. “never mind,” he said gruffly. “never mind. she had a great old life — ” “hagrid!” said ted tonks warningly as the hairbrush glowed bright blue and hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time. with a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward harry was pulled into nothingness spinning uncontrollably his finger glued to the portkey as he and hagrid hurtled away from mr. tonks. seconds later harry’s feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the burrow. he heard screams. throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush harry stood up swaying slightly and saw mrs. weasley and ginny running down the steps by the back door as hagrid who had also collapsed on landing clambered laboriously to his feet. “harry you are the real harry what happened where are the others?” cried mrs. weasley. “what d’you mean isn’t anyone else back?” harry panted. the answer was clearly etched in mrs. weasley ’s pale face. “the death eaters were waiting for us,” harry told her. “we were surrounded the moment we took off — they knew it was tonight — i don’t know what happened to anyone else four of them chased us it was all we could do to get away and then voldemort caught up with us — ” he could hear the self-justifying note in his voice the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons but — “thank goodness you’re all right,” she said pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved. “haven’t go’ any brandy have yeh molly?” asked hagrid a little shakily. “fer medicinal purposes?” she could have summoned it by magic but as she hurried back toward the crooked house harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. he turned to ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once. “ron and tonks should have been back first but they missed their portkey it came back without them,” she said pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. “and that one,” she pointed at an ancient sneaker “should have been dad and fred’s they were supposed to be second. you and hagrid were third and,” she checked her watch “if they made it george and lupin ought to be back in about a minute.” mrs. weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy which she handed to hagrid. he uncorked it and drank it straight down in one. “mum!” shouted ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. a blue light had appeared in the darkness it grew larger and brighter and lupin and george appeared spinning and then falling. harry knew immediately that there was something wrong lupin was supporting george who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood. harry ran forward and seized george’s legs. together he and lupin carried george into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room where they laid him on the sofa. as the lamplight fell across george’s head ginny gasped and harry’s stomach lurched one of george’s ears was missing. the side of his head and neck were drenched in wet shockingly scarlet blood. no sooner had mrs. weasley bent over her son than lupin grabbed harry by the upper arm and dragged him none too gently back into the kitchen where hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door. “oi!” said hagrid indignantly. “le’ go of him! le’ go of harry!” lupin ignored him. “what creature sat in the corner the first time that harry potter visited my office at hogwarts?” he said giving harry a small shake. “answer me!” “a — a grindylow in a tank wasn’t it?” lupin released harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. “wha’ was tha’ about?” roared hagrid. “i’m sorry harry but i had to check,” said lupin tersely. “we’ve been betrayed. voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. you might have been an impostor.” “so why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted hagrid still struggling to fit through the door. “you’re half-giant,” said lupin looking up at hagrid. “the polyjuice potion is designed for human use only.” “none of the order would have told voldemort we were moving tonight,” said harry. the idea was dreadful to him he could not believe it of any of them. “voldemort only caught up with me toward the end he didn’t know which one i was in the beginning. if he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the start i was the one with hagrid.” “voldemort caught up with you?” said lupin sharply. “what happened how did you escape?” harry explained briefly how the death eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true harry how they had abandoned the chase how they must have summoned voldemort who had appeared just before he and hagrid had reached the sanctuary of tonks’s parents. “they recognized you but how what had you done?” “i ...” harry tried to remember the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. “i saw stan shunpike. ... you know the bloke who was the conductor on the knight bus and i tried to disarm him instead of — well he doesn’t know what he’s doing does he he must be imperiused!” lupin looked aghast. “harry the time for disarming is past! these people are trying to capture and kill you! at least stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!” “we were hundreds of feet up! stan’s not himself and if i stunned him and he’d fallen he’d have died the same as if i’d used avada kedavra! expelliarmus saved me from voldemort two years ago,” harry added defiantly. lupin was reminding him of the sneering hufflepuff zacharias smith who had jeered at harry for wanting to teach dumbledore’s army how to disarm. “yes harry,” said lupin with painful restraint “and a great number of death eaters witnessed that happening! forgive me but it was a very unusual move then under imminent threat of death. repeating it tonight in front of death eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!” “so you think i should have killed stan shunpike?” said harry angrily. “of course not,” said lupin “but the death eaters — frankly most people! — would have expected you to attack back! expelliarmus is a useful spell harry but the death eaters seem to think it is your signature move and i urge you not to let it become so!” lupin was making harry feel idiotic and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him. “i won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said harry. “that’s voldemort’s job.” lupin’s retort was lost finally succeeding in squeezing through the door hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down it collapsed beneath him. ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies harry addressed lupin again. “will george be okay?” all lupin’s frustration with harry seemed to drain away at the question. “i think so although there’s no chance of replacing his ear not when it’s been cursed off — ” there was a scuffling from outside. lupin dived for the back door harry leapt over hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard. two figures had appeared in the yard and as harry ran toward them he realized they were hermione now returning to her normal appearance and kingsley both clutching a bent coat hanger. hermione flung herself into harry’s arms but kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. over hermione ’s shoulder harry saw him raise his wand and point it at lupin’s chest. “the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?” “ ‘harry is the best hope we have. trust him,’ ” said lupin calmly. kingsley turned his wand on harry but lupin said “it’s him i’ve checked!” “all right all right!” said kingsley stowing his wand back beneath his cloak. “but somebody betrayed us! they knew they knew it was tonight!” “so it seems,” replied lupin “but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven harrys.” “small comfort!” snarled kingsley. “who else is back?” “only harry hagrid george and me.” hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. “what happened to you?” lupin asked kingsley. “followed by five injured two might’ve killed one,” kingsley reeled off “and we saw you-know-who as well he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. remus he can — ” “fly,” supplied harry. “i saw him too he came after hagrid and me.” “so that’s why he left to follow you!” said kingsley. “i couldn’t understand why he’d vanished. but what made him change targets?” “harry behaved a little too kindly to stan shunpike,” said lupin. “stan?” repeated hermione. “but i thought he was in azkaban?” kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. “hermione there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the ministry has hushed up. travers’s hood fell off when i cursed him he’s supposed to be inside too. but what happened to you remus where’s george?” “he lost an ear,” said lupin. “lost an — ” repeated hermione in a high voice. “snape’s work,” said lupin. “ snape ” shouted harry. “you didn’t say — ” “he lost his hood during the chase. sectumsempra was always a specialty of snape’s. i wish i could say i’d paid him back in kind but it was all i could do to keep george on the broom after he was injured he was losing so much blood.” silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. there was no sign of movement the stars stared back unblinking indifferent unobscured by flying friends. where was ron where were fred and mr. weasley where were bill fleur tonks mad-eye and mundungus “harry give us a hand!” called hagrid hoarsely from the door in which he was stuck again. glad of something to do harry pulled him free then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room where mrs. weasley and ginny were still tending to george. mrs. weasley had staunched his bleeding now and by the lamplight harry saw a clean gaping hole where george’s ear had been. “how is he?” mrs. weasley looked around and said “i can’t make it grow back not when it’s been removed by dark magic. but it could have been so much worse. ... he’s alive.” “yeah,” said harry. “thank god.” “did i hear someone else in the yard?” ginny asked. “hermione and kingsley,” said harry. “thank goodness,” ginny whispered. they looked at each other harry wanted to hug her hold on to her he did not even care much that mrs. weasley was there but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen. “i’ll prove who i am kingsley after i’ve seen my son now back off if you know what’s good for you!” harry had never heard mr. weasley shout like that before. he burst into the living room his bald patch gleaming with sweat his spectacles askew fred right behind him both pale but uninjured. “arthur!” sobbed mrs. weasley. “oh thank goodness!” “how is he?” mr. weasley dropped to his knees beside george. for the first time since harry had known him fred seemed to be lost for words. he gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing. perhaps roused by the sound of fred and their father’s arrival george stirred. “how do you feel georgie?” whispered mrs. weasley. george’s fingers groped for the side of his head. “saintlike,” he murmured. “what’s wrong with him?” croaked fred looking terrified. “is his mind affected?” “saintlike,” repeated george opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. “you see ... i’m holy. hole v fred geddit?” mrs. weasley sobbed harder than ever. color flooded fred’s pale face. “pathetic,” he told george. “pathetic! with the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you you go for holey?” “ah well,” said george grinning at his tear-soaked mother. “you’ll be able to tell us apart now anyway mum.” he looked around. “hi harry — you are harry right?” “yeah i am,” said harry moving closer to the sofa. “well at least we got you back okay,” said george. “why aren’t ron and bill huddled round my sickbed?” “they’re not back yet george,” said mrs. weasley. george’s grin faded. harry glanced at ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. as they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice “ron and tonks should be back by now. they didn’t have a long journey auntie muriel’s not that far from here.” harry said nothing. he had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the burrow but now it enveloped him seeming to crawl over his skin throbbing in his chest clogging his throat. as they walked down the back steps into the dark yard ginny took his hand. kingsley was striding backward and forward glancing up at the sky every time he turned. harry was reminded of uncle vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. hagrid hermione and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder gazing upward in silence. none of them looked around when harry and ginny joined their silent vigil. the minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. the slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing order members might leap unscathed from its leaves — and then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground — “it’s them!” screamed hermione. tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. “remus!” tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into lupin’s arms. his face was set and white he seemed unable to speak. ron tripped dazedly toward harry and hermione. “you’re okay,” he mumbled before hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly. “i thought — i thought — ” “ ’m all right,” said ron patting her on the back. “ ’m fine.” “ron was great,” said tonks warmly relinquishing her hold on lupin. “wonderful. stunned one of the death eaters straight to the head and when you’re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom — ” “you did?” said hermione gazing up at ron with her arms still around his neck. “always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily breaking free. “are we the last back?” “no,” said ginny “we’re still waiting for bill and fleur and mad-eye and mundungus. i’m going to tell mum and dad you’re okay ron — ” she ran back inside. “so what kept you what happened?” lupin sounded almost angry at tonks. “bellatrix,” said tonks. “she wants me quite as much as she wants harry remus she tried very hard to kill me. i just wish i’d got her i owe bellatrix. but we definitely injured rodolphus. ... then we got to ron’s auntie muriel’s and we’d missed our portkey and she was fussing over us — ” a muscle was jumping in lupin’s jaw. he nodded but seemed unable to say anything else. “so what happened to you lot?” tonks asked turning to harry hermione and kingsley. they recounted the stories of their own journeys but all the time the continued absence of bill fleur mad eye and mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost its icy bite harder and harder to ignore. “i’m going to have to get back to downing street i should have been there an hour ago,” said kingsley finally after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. “let me know when they’re back.” lupin nodded. with a wave to the others kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate. harry thought he heard the faintest pop as kingsley disapparated just beyond the burrow’s boundaries. mr. and mrs. weasley came racing down the back steps ginny behind them. both parents hugged ron before turning to lupin and tonks. “thank you,” said mrs. weasley “for our sons.” “don’t be silly molly,” said tonks at once. “how’s george?” asked lupin. “what’s wrong with him?” piped up ron. “he’s lost — ” but the end of mrs. weasley ’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry a thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. bill and fleur slid from its back windswept but unhurt. “bill! thank god thank god — ” mrs. weasley ran forward but the hug bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. looking directly at his father he said “mad-eye’s dead.” nobody spoke nobody moved. harry felt as though something inside him was falling falling through the earth leaving him forever. “we saw it,” said bill fleur nodded tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. “it happened just after we broke out of the circle mad-eye and dung were close by us they were heading north too. voldemort — he can fly — went straight for them. dung panicked i heard him cry out mad-eye tried to stop him but he disapparated. voldemort’s curse hit mad-eye full in the face he fell backward off his broom and — there was nothing we could do nothing we had half a dozen of them on our own tail — ” bill’s voice broke. “of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said lupin. they all stood looking at each other. harry could not quite comprehend it. mad-eye dead it could not be. ... mad-eye so tough so brave the consummate survivor ... at last it seemed to dawn on everyone though nobody said it that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore and in silence they followed mr. and mrs. weasley back into the burrow and into the living room where fred and george were laughing together. “what’s wrong?” said fred scanning their faces as they entered. “what’s happened who’s — ” “mad-eye,” said mr. weasley. “dead.” the twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. nobody seemed to know what to do. tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief she had been close to mad-eye harry knew his favorite and his protegee at the ministry of magic. hagrid who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief. bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses. “here,” he said and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them holding the thirteenth aloft. “mad-eye.” “mad-eye,” they all said and drank. “mad-eye,” echoed hagrid a little late with a hiccup. the firewhisky seared harry’s throat. it seemed to burn feeling back into him dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage. “so mundungus disappeared?” said lupin who had drained his own glass in one. the atmosphere changed at once. everybody looked tense watching lupin both wanting him to go on it seemed to harry and slightly afraid of what they might hear. “i know what you’re thinking,” said bill “and i wondered that too on the way back here because they seemed to be expecting us didn’t they but mundungus can’t have betrayed us. they didn’t know there would be seven harrys that confused them the moment we appeared and in case you’ve forgotten it was mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery. why wouldn’t he have told them the essential point i think dung panicked it’s as simple as that. he didn’t want to come in the first place but mad-eye made him and you-know-who went straight for them. it was enough to make anyone panic.” “you-know-who acted exactly as mad-eye expected him to,” sniffed tonks. “mad-eye said he’d expect the real harry to be with the toughest most skilled aurors. he chased mad-eye first and when mundungus gave them away he switched to kingsley. “yes and zat eez all very good,” snapped fleur “but still eet does not explain ’ow zey knew we were moving ’arry tonight does eet somebody must ’ave been careless. somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. it is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ’ole plan.” she glared around at them all tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face silently daring any of them to contradict her. nobody did. the only sound to break the silence was that of hagrid hiccuping from behind his handkerchief. harry glanced at hagrid who had just risked his own life to save harry’s — hagrid whom he loved whom he trusted who had once been tricked into giving voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg. ... “no,” harry said aloud and they all looked at him surprised the firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. “i mean ... if somebody made a mistake,” harry went on “and let something slip i know they didn’t mean to do it. it’s not their fault,” he repeated again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. “we’ve got to trust each other. i trust all of you i don’t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to voldemort.” more silence followed his words. they were all looking at him harry felt a little hot again and drank some more firewhisky for something to do. as he drank he thought of mad-eye. mad-eye had always been scathing about dumbledore’s willingness to trust people. “well said harry,” said fred unexpectedly. “yeah ’ear ’ear,” said george with half a glance at fred the corner of whose mouth twitched. lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at harry. it was close to pitying. “you think i’m a fool?” demanded harry. “no i think you’re like james,” said lupin “who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.” harry knew what lupin was getting at that his father had been betrayed by his friend peter pettigrew. he felt irrationally angry. he wanted to argue but lupin had turned away from him set down his glass upon a side table and addressed bill “there’s work to do. i can ask kingsley whether — ” “no,” said bill at once “i’ll do it i’ll come.” “where are you going?” said tonks and fleur together. “mad-eye’s body,” said lupin. “we need to recover it.” “can’t it — ” began mrs. weasley with an appealing look at bill. “wait?” said bill. “not unless you’d rather the death eaters took it?” nobody spoke. lupin and bill said good-bye and left. the rest of them now dropped into chairs all except for harry who remained standing. the suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence. “i’ve got to go too,” said harry. ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. “don’t be silly harry,” said mrs. weasley. “what are you talking about?” “i can’t stay here.” he rubbed his forehead it was prickling again it had not hurt like this for more than a year. “you’re all in danger while i’m here. i don’t want — ” “but don’t be so silly!” said mrs. weasley. “the whole point of tonight was to get you here safely and thank goodness it worked. and fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in france we’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you — ” she did not understand she was making him feel worse not better. “if voldemort finds out i’m here — ” “but why should he?” asked mrs. weasley. “there are a dozen places you might be now harry,” said mr. weasley. “he’s got no way of knowing which safe house you’re in.” “it’s not me i’m worried for!” said harry. “we know that,” said mr. weasley quietly “but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.” “yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled hagrid. “blimey harry after all we wen’ through ter get you here?” “yeah what about my bleeding ear?” said george hoisting himself up on his cushions. “i know that — ” “mad-eye wouldn’t want — ” “i know!” harry bellowed. he felt beleaguered and blackmailed did they think he did not know what they had done for him didn’t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now before they had to suffer any more on his behalf there was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb and which was broken at last by mrs. weasley. “where’s hedwig harry?” she said coaxingly. “we can put her up with pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.” his insides clenched like a fist. he could not tell her the truth. he drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering. “wait till it gets out yeh did it again harry,” said hagrid. “escaped him fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!” “it wasn’t me,” said harry flatly. “it was my wand. my wand acted of its own accord.” after a few moments hermione said gently “but that’s impossible harry. you mean that you did magic without meaning to you reacted instinctively.” “no,” said harry. “the bike was falling i couldn’t have told you where voldemort was but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him and it wasn’t even a spell i recognized. i’ve never made gold flames appear before.” “often,” said mr. weasley “when you’re in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of. small children often find before they’re trained — ” “it wasn’t like that,” said harry through gritted teeth. his scar was burning he felt angry and frustrated he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match voldemort’s. no one said anything. he knew that they did not believe him. now that he came to think of it he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before. his scar seared with pain it was all he could do not to moan aloud. muttering about fresh air he set down his glass and left the room. as he crossed the dark yard the great skeletal thestral looked up rustled its enormous batlike wings then resumed its grazing. harry stopped at the gate into the garden staring out at its overgrown plants rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of dumbledore. dumbledore would have believed him he knew it. dumbledore would have known how and why harry’s wand had acted independently because dumbledore always had the answers he had known about wands had explained to harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and voldemort’s. ... but dumbledore like mad-eye like sirius like his parents like his poor owl all were gone where harry could never talk to them again. he felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky . . . and then out of nowhere the pain in his scar peaked. as he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes a voice screamed inside his head. “ you told me the problem would be solved by using another’s wand\” and into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor screaming a horrible drawn-out scream a scream of unendurable agony. ... “no! no! i beg you i beg you. ...” “you lied to lord voldemort ollivander!” “i did not. ... i swear i did not. ...” “you sought to help potter to help him escape me!” “i swear i did not. ... i believed a different wand would work. ...” “explain then what happened. lucius’s wand is destroyed!” “i cannot understand. ... the connection ... exists only ... between your two wands. ...” “lies!” “please ... i beg you. ...” and harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt voldemort ’s surge of vicious anger saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony — “harry?” it was over as quickly as it had come harry stood shaking in the darkness clutching the gate into the garden his heart racing his scar still tingling. it was several moments before he realized that ron and hermione were at his side. “harry come back in the house,” hermione whispered. “you aren’t still thinking of leaving?” “yeah you’ve got to stay mate,” said ron thumping harry on the back. “are you all right?” hermione asked close enough now to look into harry’s face. “you look awful!” “well,” said harry shakily “i probably look better than ollivander. ...” when he had finished telling them what he had seen ron looked appalled but hermione downright terrified. “but it was supposed to have stopped! your scar — it wasn’t supposed to do this anymore! you mustn’t let that connection open up again — dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!” when he did not reply she gripped his arm. “harry he’s taking over the ministry and the newspapers and half the wizarding world! don’t let him inside your head too!” 6 the ghoul in pajamas the shock of losing mad-eye hung over the house in the days that followed harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other order members who passed in and out to relay news. harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy horcruxes as soon as possible. “well you can’t do anything about the” — ron mouthed the word horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen. you’ve still got the trace on you. and we can plan here as well as anywhere can’t we or,” he dropped his voice to a whisper “d’you reckon you already know where the you-know-whats are?” “no,” harry admitted. “i think hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said ron. “she said she was saving it for when you got here.” they were sitting at the breakfast table mr. weasley and bill had just left for work. mrs. weasley had gone upstairs to wake hermione and ginny while fleur had drifted off to take a bath. “the trace’ll break on the thirty first,” said harry. “that means i only need to stay here four days. then i can — ” “five days,” ron corrected him firmly. “we’ve got to stay for the wedding. they’ll kill us if we miss it.” harry understood “they” to mean fleur and mrs. weasley. “it’s one extra day,” said ron when harry looked mutinous. “don’t they realize how important — ” “ ’course they don’t,” said ron. “they haven’t got a clue. and now you mention it i wanted to talk to you about that.” ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that mrs. weasley was not returning yet then leaned in closer to harry. “mum’s been trying to get it out of hermione and me. what we’re off to do. she’ll try you next so brace yourself. dad and lupin ’ve both asked as well but when we said dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us they dropped it. not mum though. she’s determined.” ron’s prediction came true within hours. shortly before lunch mrs. weasley detached harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack. once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen she started. “ron and hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of hogwarts,” she began in a light casual tone. “oh,” said harry. “well yeah. we are.” the mangle turned of its own accord in a corner wringing out what looked like one of mr. weasley’s vests. “may i ask why you are abandoning your education?” said mrs. weasley. “well dumbledore left me ... stuff to do,” mumbled harry. “ron and hermione know about it and they want to come too.” “what sort of ‘stuff’?” “i’m sorry i can’t — ” “well frankly i think arthur and i have a right to know and i’m sure mr. and mrs. granger would agree!” said mrs. weasley. harry had been afraid of the “concerned parent” attack. he forced himself to look directly into her eyes noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as ginny’s. this did not help. “dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know mrs. weasley. i’m sorry. ron and hermione don’t have to come it’s their choice — ” “i don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped dropping all pretense now. “you’re barely of age any of you! it’s utter nonsense if dumbledore needed work doing he had the whole order at his command! harry you must have misunderstood him. probably he was telling you something he wanted done and you took it to mean that he wanted you — ” “i didn’t misunderstand,” said harry flatly. “it’s got to be me.” he handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying which was patterned with golden bulrushes. “and that’s not mine i don’t support puddlemere united.” “oh of course not,” said mrs. weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone. “i should have realized. well harry while we’ve still got you here you won’t mind helping with the preparations for bill and fleur’s wedding will you there’s still so much to do.” “no — i — of course not,” said harry disconcerted by this sudden change of subject. “sweet of you,” she replied and she smiled as she left the scullery. from that moment on mrs. weasley kept harry ron and hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. the kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that mrs. weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of mad-eye and the terrors of their recent journey. after two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning of color-matching favors ribbons and flowers of de gnoming the garden and helping mrs. weasley cook vast batches of canapes however harry started to suspect her of a different motive. all the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him ron and hermione away from one another he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night when he had told them about voldemort torturing ollivander. “i think mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning she’ll be able to delay you leaving,” ginny told harry in an undertone as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay. “and then what does she think’s going to happen?” harry muttered. “someone else might kill off voldemort while she’s holding us here making vol-au vents?” he had spoken without thinking and saw ginny’s face whiten. “so it’s true?” she said. “that’s what you’re trying to do?” “i — not — i was joking,” said harry evasively. they stared at each other and there was something more than shock in ginny’s expression. suddenly harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the hogwarts grounds. he was sure she was remembering them too. both of them jumped as the door opened and mr. weasley kingsley and bill walked in. they were often joined by other order members for dinner now because the burrow had replaced number twelve grimmauld place as the headquarters. mr. weasley had explained that after the death of dumbledore their secret-keeper each of the people to whom dumbledore had confided grimmauld place’s location had become a secret keeper in turn. “and as there are around twenty of us that greatly dilutes the power of the fidelius charm. twenty times as many opportunities for the death eaters to get the secret out of somebody. we can’t expect it to hold much longer.” “but surely snape will have told the death eaters the address by now?” asked harry. “well mad-eye set up a couple of curses against snape in case he turns up there again. we hope they’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place but we can’t be sure. it would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.” the kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. harry found himself crammed beside ginny the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people. he was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken. “no news about mad-eye?” harry asked bill. “nothing,” replied bill. they had not been able to hold a funeral for moody because bill and lupin had failed to recover his body. it had been difficult to know where he might have fallen given the darkness and the confusion of the battle. “the daily prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,” bill went on. “but that doesn’t mean much. it’s keeping a lot quiet these days.” “and they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage magic i used escaping the death eaters?” harry called across the table to mr. weasley who shook his head. “because they know i had no choice or because they don’t want me to tell the world voldemort attacked me?” “the latter i think. scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that you-know-who is as powerful as he is nor that azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.” “yeah why tell the public the truth?” said harry clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out white against his skin i must not tell lies. “isn’t anyone at the ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked ron angrily. “of course ron but people are terrified,” mr. weasley replied “terrified that they will be next to disappear their children the next to be attacked! there are nasty rumors going around i for one don’t believe the muggle studies professor at hogwarts resigned. she hasn’t been seen for weeks now. meanwhile scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day i just hope he’s working on a plan.” there was a pause in which mrs. weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart. “we must decide ’ow you will be disguised ’arry,” said fleur once everyone had pudding. “for ze wedding,” she added when he looked confused. “of course none of our guests are death eaters but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ave ’ad champagne.” from this harry gathered that she still suspected hagrid. “yes good point,” said mrs. weasley from the top of the table where she sat spectacles perched on the end of her nose scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. “now ron have you cleaned out your room yet?” “ why?” exclaimed ron slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. “why does my room have to be cleaned out harry and i are fine with it the way it is!” “we are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time young man — ” “and are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked ron furiously. “no! so why in the name of merlin’s saggy left — ” “don’t talk to your mother like that,” said mr. weasley firmly. “and do as you’re told.” ron scowled at both his parents then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart. “i can help some of it’s my mess,” harry told ron but mrs. weasley cut across him. “no harry dear i’d much rather you helped arthur muck out the chickens and hermione i’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets for monsieur and madame delacour you know they’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.” but as it turned out there was very little to do for the chickens. “there’s no need to er mention it to molly,” mr. weasley told harry blocking his access to the coop “but er ted tonks sent me most of what was left of sirius’s bike and er i’m hiding — that’s to say keeping — it in here. fantastic stuff there’s an exhaust gaskin as i believe it’s called the most magnificent battery and it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. i’m going to try and put it all back together again when molly’s not — i mean when i’ve got time.” when they returned to the house mrs. weasley was nowhere to be seen so harry slipped upstairs to ron’s attic bedroom. “i’m doing it i’m doing — ! oh it’s you,” said ron in relief as harry entered the room. ron lay back down on the bed which he had evidently just vacated. the room was just as messy as it had been all week the only change was that hermione was now sitting in the far corner her fluffy ginger cat crookshanks at her feet sorting books some of which harry recognized as his own into two enormous piles. “hi harry,” she said as he sat down on his camp bed. “and how did you manage to get away?” “oh ron’s mum forgot that she asked ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,” said hermione. she threw numerology and grammatica onto one pile and the rise and fall of the dark arts onto the other. “we were just talking about mad-eye,” ron told harry. “i reckon he might have survived.” “but bill saw him hit by the killing curse,” said harry. “yeah but bill was under attack too,” said ron. “how can he be sure what he saw?” “even if the killing curse missed mad-eye still fell about a thousand feet,” said hermione now weighing quidditch teams of britain and ireland in her hand. “he could have used a shield charm — ” “fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said harry. “well all right if you want him to be dead,” said ron grumpily punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape. “of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said hermione looking shocked. “it’s dreadful that he’s dead! but we’re being realistic!” for the first time harry imagined mad-eye’s body broken as dumbledore’s had been yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. he felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh. “the death eaters probably tidied up after themselves that’s why no one’s found him,” said ron wisely. “yeah,” said harry. “like barty crouch turned into a bone and buried in hagrid’s front garden. they probably transfigured moody and stuffed him — ” “don’t!” squealed hermione. startled harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of spellman’s syllabary. “oh no,” said harry struggling to get up from the old camp bed. “hermione i wasn’t trying to upset — ” but with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings ron bounded off the bed and got there first. one arm around hermione he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. hastily pulling out his wand he pointed it at the rag and said “ tergeo .” the wand siphoned off most of the grease. looking rather pleased with himself ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to hermione. “oh ... thanks ron. ... i’m sorry. ...” she blew her nose and hiccuped. “it’s just so awf-ful isn’t it r right after dumbledore ... i j-just n-never imagined mad-eye dying somehow he seemed so tough!” “yeah i know,” said ron giving her a squeeze. “but you know what he’d say to us if he was here?” “ ‘c-constant vigilance,’ ” said hermione mopping her eyes. “that’s right,” said ron nodding. “he’d tell us to learn from what happened to him. and what i’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit mundungus.” hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. a second later ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders she had dropped the monster book of monsters on his foot. the book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at ron’s ankle. “i’m sorry i’m sorry!” hermione cried as harry wrenched the book from ron’s leg and retied it shut. “what are you doing with all those books anyway?” ron asked limping back to his bed. “just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said hermione. “when we’re looking for the horcruxes.” “oh of course,” said ron clapping a hand to his forehead. “i forgot we’ll be hunting down voldemort in a mobile library.” “ha ha,” said hermione looking down at spellman’s syllabary. “i wonder ... will we need to translate runes it’s possible. ... i think we’d better take it to be safe.” she dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up hogwarts a history. “listen,” said harry. he had sat up straight. ron and hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. “i know you said after dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,” harry began. “here he goes,” ron said to hermione rolling his eyes. “as we knew he would,” she sighed turning back to the books. “you know i think i will take hogwarts a history. even if we’re not going back there i don’t think i’d feel right if i didn’t have it with — ” “listen!” said harry again. “no harry you listen,” said hermione. “we’re coming with you. that was decided months ago — years really.” “but — ” “shut up,” ron advised him. “ — are you sure you’ve thought this through?” harry persisted. “let’s see,” said hermione slamming travels with trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “i’ve been packing for days so we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic not to mention smuggling mad-eye’s whole stock of polyjuice potion right under ron’s mum’s nose. “i’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re convinced they’re really called wendell and monica wilkins and that their life’s ambition is to move to australia which they have now done. that’s to make it more difficult for voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me — or you because unfortunately i’ve told them quite a bit about you. “assuming i survive our hunt for the horcruxes i’ll find mum and dad and lift the enchantment. if i don’t — well i think i’ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. wendell and monica wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daughter you see.” hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. ron got back off the bed put his arm around her once more and frowned at harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. harry could not think of anything to say not least because it was highly unusual for ron to be teaching anyone else tact. “i — hermione i’m sorry — i didn’t — ” “didn’t realize that ron and i know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you well we do. ron show harry what you’ve done.” “nah he’s just eaten,” said ron. “go on he needs to know!” “oh all right. harry come here.” for the second time ron withdrew his arm from around hermione and stumped over to the door. “c’mon.” “why?” harry asked following ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. “ descendo,” muttered ron pointing his wand at the low ceiling. a hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. a horrible half sucking half-moaning sound came out of the square hole along with an unpleasant smell like open drains. “that’s your ghoul isn’t it?” asked harry who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. “yeah it is,” said ron climbing the ladder. “come and have a look at him.” harry followed ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. his head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open. “but it ... it looks ... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?” “no,” said ron. “nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules.” harry contemplated the thing slightly revolted. it was human in shape and size and was wearing what now that harry’s eyes became used to the darkness was clearly an old pair of ron’s pajamas. he was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. “he’s me see?” said ron. “no,” said harry. “i don’t.” “i’ll explain it back in my room the smell’s getting to me,” said ron. they climbed back down the ladder which ron returned to the ceiling and rejoined hermione who was still sorting books. “once we’ve left the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my room,” said ron. “i think he’s really looking forward to it — well it’s hard to tell because all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a lot when you mention it. anyway he’s going to be me with spattergroit. good eh?” harry merely looked his confusion. “it is!” said ron clearly frustrated that harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. “look when we three don’t turn up at hogwarts again everyone’s going to think hermione and i must be with you right which means the death eaters will go straight for our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are.” “but hopefully it’ll look like i’ve gone away with mum and dad a lot of muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,” said hermione. “we can’t hide my whole family it’ll look too fishy and they can’t all leave their jobs,” said ron. “so we’re going to put out the story that i’m seriously ill with spattergroit which is why i can’t go back to school. if anyone comes calling to investigate mum or dad can show them the ghoul in my bed covered in pustules. spattergroit ’s really contagious so they’re not going to want to go near him. it won’t matter that he can’t say anything either because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.” “and your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked harry. “dad is. he helped fred and george transform the ghoul. mum ... well you’ve seen what she’s like. she won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone.” there was silence in the room broken only by gentle thuds as hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other. ron sat watching her and harry looked from one to the other unable to say anything. the measures they had taken to protect their families made him realize more than anything else could have done that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. he wanted to tell them what that meant to him but he simply could not find words important enough. through the silence came the muffled sounds of mrs. weasley shouting from four floors below. “ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said ron. “i dunno why the delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.” “fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid she needs to be here for the rehearsal and she’s too young to come on her own,” said hermione as she pored indecisively over break with a banshee. “well guests aren’t going to help mum’s stress levels,” said ron. “what we really need to decide,” said hermione tossing defensive magical theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up an appraisal of magical education in europe “is where we’re going after we leave here. i know you said you wanted to go to godric’s hollow first harry and i understand why but ... well ... shouldn’t we make the horcruxes our priority?” “if we knew where any of the horcruxes were i’d agree with you,” said harry who did not believe that hermione really understood his desire to return to godric’s hollow. his parents’ graves were only part of the attraction he had a strong though inexplicable feeling that the place held answers for him. perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived voldemort’s killing curse now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat harry was drawn to the place where it had happened wanting to understand. “don’t you think there’s a possibility that voldemort’s keeping a watch on godric’s hollow?” hermione asked. “he might expect you to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you like?” this had not occurred to harry. while he struggled to find a counterargument ron spoke up evidently following his own train of thought. “this r.a.b. person,” he said. “you know the one who stole the real locket?” hermione nodded. “he said in his note he was going to destroy it didn’t he?” harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake horcrux in which r.a.b. ’s note was still folded. “ ‘ i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can,’ ” harry read out. “well what if he did finish it off?” said ron. “or she,” interposed hermione. “whichever,” said ron “it’d be one less for us to do!” “yes but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket aren’t we?” said hermione “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.” “and once we get hold of it how do you destroy a horcrux?” asked ron. “well,” said hermione “i’ve been researching that.” “how?” asked harry. “i didn’t think there were any books on horcruxes in the library?” “there weren’t,” said hermione who had turned pink. “dumbledore removed them all but he — he didn’t destroy them.” ron sat up straight wide-eyed. “how in the name of merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands on those horcrux books?” “it — it wasn’t stealing!” said hermione looking from harry to ron with a kind of desperation. “they were still library books even if dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. anyway if he really didn’t want anyone to get at them i’m sure he would have made it much harder to — ” “get to the point!” said ron. “well ... it was easy,” said hermione in a small voice. “i just did a summoning charm. you know — accio. and — they zoomed out of dumbledore ’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.” “but when did you do this?” harry asked regarding hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity. “just after his — dumbledore’s — funeral,” said hermione in an even smaller voice. “right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the horcruxes. when i went back upstairs to get my things it — it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be ... and i was alone in there ... so i tried ... and it worked. they flew straight in through the open window and i — i packed them.” she swallowed and then said imploringly “i can’t believe dumbledore would have been angry it’s not as though we’re going to use the information to make a horcrux is it?” “can you hear us complaining?” said ron. “where are these books anyway?” hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume bound in faded black leather. she looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead. “this is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a horcrux. secrets of the darkest art — it’s a horrible book really awful full of evil magic. i wonder when dumbledore removed it from the library. ... if he didn’t do it until he was headmaster i bet voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.” “why did he have to ask slughorn how to make a horcrux then if he’d already read that?” asked ron. “he only approached slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,” said harry. “dumbledore was sure riddle already knew how to make a horcrux by the time he asked slughorn about them. i think you’re right hermione that could easily have been where he got the information.” “and the more i’ve read about them,” said hermione “the more horrible they seem and the less i can believe that he actually made six. it warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it and that’s just by making one horcrux!” harry remembered what dumbledore had said about voldemort moving beyond “usual evil.” “isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” ron asked. “yes,” said hermione with a hollow smile “but it would be excruciatingly painful.” “why how do you do it?” asked harry. “remorse,” said hermione. “you’ve got to really feel what you’ve done. there’s a footnote. apparently the pain of it can destroy you. i can’t see voldemort attempting it somehow can you?” “no,” said ron before harry could answer. “so does it say how to destroy horcruxes in that book?” “yes,” said hermione now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails “because it warns dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. from all that i’ve read what harry did to riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a horcrux.” “what stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked harry. “oh well lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs then,” said ron. “i was wondering what we were going to do with them.” “it doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said hermione patiently. “it has to be something so destructive that the horcrux can’t repair itself. basilisk venom only has one antidote and it’s incredibly rare — □ “ — phoenix tears,” said harry nodding. “exactly,” said hermione. “our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom and they’re all dangerous to carry around with you. that’s a problem we’re going to have to solve though because ripping smashing or crushing a horcrux won’t do the trick. you’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.” “but even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said ron “why can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?” “because a horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” seeing that harry and ron looked thoroughly confused hermione hurried on “look if i picked up a sword right now ron and ran you through with it i wouldn’t damage your soul at all.” “which would be a real comfort to me i’m sure,” said ron. harry laughed. “it should be actually! but my point is that whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched,” said hermione. “but it’s the other way round with a horcrux. the fragment of soul inside it depends on its container its enchanted body for survival. it can’t exist without it.” “that diary sort of died when i stabbed it,” said harry remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages and the screams of the piece of voldemort’s soul as it vanished. “and once the diary was properly destroyed the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did flushing it away but obviously it came back good as new.” “hang on,” said ron frowning. “the bit of soul in that diary was possessing ginny wasn’t it how does that work then?” “while the magical container is still intact the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. i don’t mean holding it for too long it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added before ron could speak. “i mean close emotionally. ginny poured her heart out into that diary she made herself incredibly vulnerable. you’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the horcrux.” “i wonder how dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said harry. “why didn’t i ask him i never really ...” his voice tailed away he was thinking of all the things he should have asked dumbledore and of how since the headmaster had died it seemed to harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when dumbledore had been alive to find out more ... to find out everything. . . . the silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. hermione shrieked and dropped secrets of the darkest art crookshanks streaked under the bed hissing indignantly ron jumped off the bed skidded on a discarded chocolate frog wrapper and smacked his head on the opposite wall and harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at mrs. weasley whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. “i’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said her voice trembling. “i’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and i was under the impression that you had agreed to help.” “oh yes,” said hermione looking terrified as she leapt to her feet sending books flying in every direction “we will ... we’re sorry ...” with an anguished look at harry and ron hermione hurried out of the room after mrs. weasley. “it’s like being a house-elf,” complained ron in an undertone still massaging his head as he and harry followed. “except without the job satisfaction. the sooner this wedding’s over the happier i’ll be.” “yeah,” said harry “then we’ll have nothing to do except find horcruxes. ... it’ll be like a holiday won’t it?” ron started to laugh but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in mrs. weasley’s room stopped quite abruptly. the delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock. harry ron hermione and ginny were feeling quite resentful toward fleur’s family by this time and it was with ill grace that ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks and harry attempted to flatten his hair. once they had all been deemed smart enough they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors. harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. the rusty cauldrons and old wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone replaced by two new flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots though there was no breeze the leaves waved lazily giving an attractive rippling effect. the chickens had been shut away the yard had been swept and the nearby garden had been pruned plucked and generally spruced up although harry who liked it in its overgrown state thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes. he had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the burrow by both the order and the ministry all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. mr. weasley had therefore gone to meet the delacours on top of a nearby hill where they were to arrive by portkey. the first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh which turned out to be coming from mr. weasley who appeared at the gate moments later laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long leaf-green robes who could only be fleur’s mother. “maman!” cried fleur rushing forward to embrace her. “papa!” monsieur delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife he was a head shorter and extremely plump with a little pointed black beard. however he looked good-natured. bouncing toward mrs. weasley on high-heeled boots he kissed her twice on each cheek leaving her flustered. “you ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “fleur tells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.” “oh it’s been nothing nothing!” trilled mrs. weasley. “no trouble at all!” ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new flutterby bushes. “dear lady!” said monsieur delacour still holding mrs. weasley’s hand between his own two plump ones and beaming. “we are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! let me present my wife apolline.” madame delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss mrs. weasley too. “ enchantee,” she said. “your ’usband ’as been telling us such amusing stories!” mr. weasley gave a maniacal laugh mrs. weasley threw him a look upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend. “and of course you ’ave met my leetle daughter gabrielle!” said monsieur delacour. gabrielle was fleur in miniature eleven years old with waist-length hair of pure silvery blonde she gave mrs. weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her then threw harry a glowing look batting her eyelashes. ginny cleared her throat loudly. “well come in do!” said mrs. weasley brightly and she ushered the delacours into the house with many “no please!”s and “after you!”s and “not at all!”s. the delacours it soon transpired were helpful pleasant guests. they were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. monsieur delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shoes “charmanti” madame delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice gabrielle followed her elder sister around trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid french. on the downside the burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. mr. and mrs. weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room having shouted down monsieur and madame delacour’s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. gabrielle was sleeping with fleur in percy’s old room and bill would be sharing with charlie his best man once charlie arrived from romania. opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent and it was in desperation that harry ron and hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house. “but she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled ron as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of mrs. weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms. “oh good you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached them. “we’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow ... to put up the tent for the wedding,” she explained pausing to lean against the henhouse. she looked exhausted. “millamant’s magic marquees ... they’re very good bill’s escorting them. ... you’d better stay inside while they’re here harry. i must say it does complicate organizing a wedding having all these security spells around the place.” “i’m sorry,” said harry humbly. “oh don’t be silly dear!” said mrs. weasley at once. “i didn’t mean — well your safety’s much more important! actually i’ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday harry. seventeen after all it’s an important day. ...” “i don’t want a fuss,” said harry quickly envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all. “really mrs. weasley just a normal dinner would be fine. ... it’s the day before the wedding. ...” “oh well if you’re sure dear. i’ll invite remus and tonks shall i and how about hagrid?” “that’d be great,” said harry. “but please don’t go to loads of trouble.” “not at all not at all ... it’s no trouble. ...” she looked at him a long searching look then smiled a little sadly straightened up and walked away. harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her. 7 the will of albus dumbledore he was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn. far below swathed in mist was the shadow of a small town. was the man he sought down there the man he needed so badly he could think of little else the man who held the answer the answer to his problem . . .  “oi wake up.” harry opened his eyes. he was lying again on the camp bed in ron’s dingy attic room. the sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. the scar on harry’s forehead was prickling. “you were muttering in your sleep.” “was i?” “yeah. ‘gregorovitch.’ you kept saying ‘gregorovitch.’ harry was not wearing his glasses ron’s face appeared slightly blurred. “who’s gregorovitch?” “i dunno do i you were the one saying it.” harry rubbed his forehead thinking. he had a vague idea he had heard the name before but he could not think where. “i think voldemort’s looking for him.” “poor bloke,” said ron fervently. harry sat up still rubbing his scar now wide awake. he tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley. “i think he’s abroad.” “who gregorovitch?” “voldemort. i think he’s somewhere abroad looking for gregorovitch. it didn’t look like anywhere in britain.” “you reckon you were seeing into his mind again?” ron sounded worried. “do me a favor and don’t tell hermione,” said harry. “although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep ...” he gazed up at little pigwidgeon’s cage thinking ... why was the name “gregorovitch” familiar “i think,” he said slowly “he’s got something to do with quidditch. there’s some connection but i can’t — i can’t think what it is.” “quidditch?” said ron. “sure you’re not thinking of gorgovitch?” “who?” “dragomir gorgovitch chaser transferred to the chudley cannons for a record fee two years ago. record holder for most quaffle drops in a season.” “no,” said harry. “i’m definitely not thinking of gorgovitch.” “i try not to either,” said ron. “well happy birthday anyway.” “wow — that’s right i forgot! i’m seventeen!” harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses and said “accio glasses!” although they were only around a foot away there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him at least until they poked him in the eye. “slick,” snorted ron. reveling in the removal of his trace harry sent ron’s possessions flying around the room causing pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand and purely for the pleasure of it turned the orange robes on ron’s chudley cannons posters bright blue. “i’d do your fly by hand though,” ron advised harry sniggering when harry immediately checked it. “here’s your present. unwrap it up here it’s not for my mother’s eyes.” “a book?” said harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “bit of a departure from tradition isn’t it?” “this isn’t your average book,” said ron. “it’s pure gold twelve fail-safe ways to charm witches. explains everything you need to know about girls. if only i’d had this last year i’d have known exactly how to get rid of lavender and i would’ve known how to get going with ... well fred and george gave me a copy and i’ve learned a lot. you’d be surprised it’s not all about wandwork either.” when they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. bill and monsieur delacour were finishing their breakfasts while mrs. weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan. “arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth harry,” said mrs. weasley beaming at him. “he had to leave early for work but hell be back for dinner. that’s our present on top.” harry sat down took the square parcel she had indicated and unwrapped it. inside was a watch very like the one mr. and mrs. weasley had given ron for his seventeenth it was gold with stars circling around the face instead of hands. “it’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,” said mrs. weasley watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. “i’m afraid that one isn’t new like ron’s it was actually my brother fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions it’s a bit dented on the back but — ” the rest of her speech was lost harry had got up and hugged her. he tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her then waved her wand in a slightly random way causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. “happy birthday harry!” said hermione hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. “it’s not much but i hope you like it. what did you get him?” she added to ron who seemed not to hear her. “come on then open hermione’s!” said ron. she had bought him a new sneakoscope. the other packages contained an enchanted razor from bill and fleur “ah yes zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ’ave,” monsieur delacour assured him “but you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzerwise you might find you ’ave a leetle less hair zan you would like. ...” chocolates from the delacours and an enormous box of the latest weasleys’ wizard wheezes merchandise from fred and george. harry ron and hermione did not linger at the table as the arrival of madame delacour fleur and gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. “i’ll pack these for you,” hermione said brightly taking harry’s presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. “i’m nearly done i’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash ron — ” ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. “harry will you come in here a moment?” it was ginny. ron came to an abrupt halt but hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs. feeling nervous harry followed ginny into her room. he had never been inside it before. it was small but bright. there was a large poster of the wizarding band the weird sisters on one wall and a picture of gwenog jones captain of the all-witch quidditch team the holyhead harpies on the other. a desk stood facing the open window which looked out over the orchard where he and ginny had once played two-a-side quidditch with ron and hermione and which now housed a large pearly white marquee. the golden flag on top was level with ginny’s window. ginny looked up into harry’s face took a deep breath and said “happy seventeenth.” “yeah ... thanks.” she was looking at him steadily he however found it difficult to look back at her it was like gazing into a brilliant light. “nice view,” he said feebly pointing toward the window. she ignored this. he could not blame her. “i couldn’t think what to get you,” she said. “you didn’t have to get me anything.” she disregarded this too. “i didn’t know what would be useful. nothing too big because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you.” he chanced a glance at her. she was not tearful that was one of the many wonderful things about ginny she was rarely weepy. he had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up. she took a step closer to him. “so then i thought i’d like you to have something to remember me by you know if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.” “i think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest.” “there’s the silver lining i’ve been looking for,” she whispered and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before and harry was kissing her back and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world ginny the feel of her one hand at her back and one in her long sweet-smelling hair — the door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. “oh,” said ron pointedly. “sorry.” “ron!” hermione was just behind him slightly out of breath. there was a strained silence then ginny said in a flat little voice “well happy birthday anyway harry.” ron’s ears were scarlet hermione looked nervous. harry wanted to slam the door in their faces but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. all the reasons for ending his relationship with ginny for staying well away from her seemed to have slunk inside the room with ron and all happy forgetfulness was gone. he looked at ginny wanting to say something though he hardly knew what but she had turned her back on him. he thought that she might have succumbed for once to tears. he could not do anything to comfort her in front of ron. “i’ll see you later,” he said and followed the other two out of the bedroom. ron marched downstairs through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard and harry kept pace with him all the way hermione trotting along behind them looking scared. once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn ron rounded on harry. “you ditched her. what are you doing now messing her around?” “i’m not messing her around,” said harry as hermione caught up with them. “ron — ” but ron held up a hand to silence her. “she was really cut up when you ended it — ” “so was i. you know why i stopped it and it wasn’t because i wanted to.” “yeah but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes up again — ” “she’s not an idiot she knows it can’t happen she’s not expecting us to — to end up married or — ” as he said it a vivid picture formed in harry’s mind of ginny in a white dress marrying a tall faceless and unpleasant stranger. in one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him her future was free and unencumbered whereas his ... he could see nothing but voldemort ahead. “if you keep groping her every chance you get — ” “it won’t happen again,” said harry harshly. the day was cloudless but he felt as though the sun had gone in. “okay?” ron looked half resentful half sheepish he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment then said “right then well that’s ... yeah.” ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with harry for the rest of the day nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. nevertheless charlie’s arrival came as a relief to harry. it provided a distraction watching mrs. weasley force charlie into a chair raise her wand threateningly and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. as harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of charlie lupin tonks and hagrid several tables were placed end to end in the garden. fred and george bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large number 17 to hang in midair over the guests. thanks to mrs. weasley’s ministrations george’s wound was neat and clean but harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head despite the twins’ many jokes about it. hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes. “nice,” said ron as with one final flourish of her wand hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “you’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.” “thank you ron!” said hermione looking both pleased and a little confused. harry turned away smiling to himself. he had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of twelve fail-safe ways to charm witches he caught ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with monsieur delacour. “out of the way out of the way!” sang mrs. weasley coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant beach-ball-sized snitch floating in front of her. seconds later harry realized that it was his birthday cake which mrs. weasley was suspending with her wand rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. when the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table harry said “that looks amazing mrs. weasley.” “oh it’s nothing dear,” she said fondly. over her shoulder ron gave harry the thumbs-up and mouthed good one. by seven o’clock all the guests had arrived led into the house by fred and george who had waited for them at the end of the lane. hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best and horrible hairy brown suit. although lupin smiled as he shook harry’s hand harry thought he looked rather unhappy. it was all very odd tonks beside him looked simply radiant. “happy birthday harry,” she said hugging him tightly. “seventeen eh!” said hagrid as he accepted a bucket sized glass of wine from fred. “six years ter the day since we met harry d’yeh remember it?” “vaguely,” said harry grinning up at him. “didn’t you smash down the front door give dudley a pig’s tail and tell me i was a wizard?” “i forge’ the details,” hagrid chortled. “all righ’ ron hermione?” “we’re fine,” said hermione. “how are you?” “ar not bad. bin busy we got some newborn unicorns i’ll show yeh when yeh get back — ” harry avoided ron’s and hermione’s gazes as hagrid rummaged in his pocket. “here harry — couldn’ think what ter get yeh but then i remembered this.” he pulled out a small slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string evidently intended to be worn around the neck. “mokeskin. hide anythin’ in there an’ no one but the owner can get it out. they’re rare them.” “hagrid thanks!” “ ’s’nothin’,” said hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid sized hand. “an’ there’s charlie! always liked him — hey! charlie!” charlie approached running his hand slightly ruefully over his new brutally short haircut. he was shorter than ron thickset with a number of burns and scratches up his muscley arms. “hi hagrid how’s it going?” “bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. how’s norbert doin’?” “norbert?” charlie laughed. “the norwegian ridgeback we call her norberta now.” “wha — norbert’s a girl?” “oh yeah,” said charlie. “how can you tell?” asked hermione. “they’re a lot more vicious,” said charlie. he looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice. “wish dad would hurry up and get here. mum’s getting edgy.” they all looked over at mrs. weasley. she was trying to talk to madame delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate. “i think we’d better start without arthur,” she called to the garden at large after a moment or two. “he must have been held up at — oh!” they all saw it at the same time a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel which stood on its hind legs and spoke with mr. weasley’s voice. “minister of magic coming with me.” the patronus dissolved into thin air leaving fleur’s family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished. “we shouldn’t be here,” said lupin at once. “harry — i’m sorry — i’ll explain another time — ” he seized tonks’s wrist and pulled her away they reached the fence climbed over it and vanished from sight. mrs. weasley looked bewildered. “the minister — but why —  i don’t understand — ” but there was no time to discuss the matter a second later mr. weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate accompanied by rufus scrimgeour instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair. the two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern lit table where everybody sat in silence watching them draw closer. as scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met scraggy and grim. “sorry to intrude,” said scrimgeour as he limped to a halt before the table. “especially as i can see that i am gate-crashing a party.” his eyes lingered for a moment on the giant snitch cake. “many happy returns.” “thanks,” said harry. “i require a private word with you,” scrimgeour went on. “also with mr. ronald weasley and miss hermione granger.” “us?” said ron sounding surprised. “why us?” “i shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said scrimgeour. “is there such a place?” he demanded of mr. weasley. “yes of course,” said mr. weasley who looked nervous. “the er sitting room why don’t you use that?” “you can lead the way,” scrimgeour said to ron. “there will be no need for you to accompany us arthur.” harry saw mr. weasley exchange a worried look with mrs. weasley as he ron and hermione stood up. as they led the way back to the house in silence harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was scrimgeour must somehow have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of hogwarts. scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen and into the burrow’s sitting room. although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light it was already dark in here harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room. scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that mr. weasley normally occupied leaving harry ron and hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. once they had done so scrimgeour spoke. “i have some questions for the three of you and i think it will be best if we do it individually. if you two” — he pointed at harry and hermione — “can wait upstairs i will start with ronald.” “we’re not going anywhere,” said harry while hermione nodded vigorously. “you can speak to us together or not at all.” scrimgeour gave harry a cold appraising look. harry had the impression that the minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. “very well then together,” he said shrugging. he cleared his throat. “i am here as i’m sure you know because of albus dumbledore’s will.” harry ron and hermione looked at one another. “a surprise apparently! you were not aware then that dumbledore had left you anything?” “a-all of us?” said ron. “me and hermione too?” “yes all of—” but harry interrupted. “dumbledore died over a month ago. why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?” “isn’t it obvious?” said hermione before scrimgeour could answer. “they wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. you had no right to do that!” she said and her voice trembled slightly. “i had every right,” said scrimgeour dismissively. “the decree for justifiable confiscation gives the ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will — ” “that law was created to stop wizards passing on dark artifacts,” said hermione “and the ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them! are you telling me that you thought dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?” “are you planning to follow a career in magical law miss granger?” asked scrimgeour. “no i’m not,” retorted hermione. “i’m hoping to do some good in the world!” ron laughed. scrimgeour ’s eyes flickered toward him and away again as harry spoke. “so why have you decided to let us have our things now can’t think of a pretext to keep them?” “no it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said hermione at once. “they can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re dangerous. right?” “would you say you were close to dumbledore ronald?” asked scrimgeour ignoring hermione. ron looked startled. “me not — not really ... it was always harry who ...” ron looked around at harry and hermione to see hermione giving him a stop-talking-now sort of look but the damage was done scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected and wanted to hear. he swooped like a bird of prey upon ron’s answer. “if you were not very close to dumbledore how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will he made exceptionally few personal bequests. the vast majority of his possessions — his private library his magical instruments and other personal effects — were left to hogwarts. why do you think you were singled out?” “i ... dunno,” said ron. “i ... when i say we weren’t close ... i mean i think he liked me. ...” “you’re being modest ron,” said hermione. “dumbledore was very fond of you.” this was stretching the truth to breaking point as far as harry knew ron and dumbledore had never been alone together and direct contact between them had been negligible. however scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. he put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one hagrid had given harry. from it he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. “ ‘the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore’ ... yes here we are. ... ‘to ronald bilius weasley i leave my deluminator in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.’ ” scrimgeour took from the bag an object that harry had seen before it looked something like a silver cigarette lighter but it had he knew the power to suck all light from a place and restore it with a simple click. scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the deluminator to ron who took it and turned it over in his fingers looking stunned. “that is a valuable object,” said scrimgeour watching ron. “it may even be unique. certainly it is of dumbledore’s own design. why would he have left you an item so rare?” ron shook his head looking bewildered. “dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” scrimgeour persevered. “yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. why is that to what use did he think you would put his deluminator mr. weasley?” “put out lights i s’pose,” mumbled ron. “what else could i do with it?” evidently scrimgeour had no suggestions. after squinting at ron for a moment or two he turned back to dumbledore’s will. “ to miss hermione jean granger i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.’ ” scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of secrets of the darkest art upstairs. its binding was stained and peeling in places. hermione took it from scrimgeour without a word. she held the book in her lap and gazed at it. harry saw that the title was in runes he had never learned to read them. as he looked a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols. “why do you think dumbledore left you that book miss granger?” asked scrimgeour. “he ... he knew i liked books,” said hermione in a thick voice mopping her eyes with her sleeve. “but why that particular book?” “i don’t know. he must have thought i’d enjoy it.” “did you ever discuss codes or any means of passing secret messages with dumbledore?” “no i didn’t,” said hermione still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. “and if the ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days i doubt that i will.” she suppressed a sob. they were wedged together so tightly that ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around hermione ’s shoulders. scrimgeour turned back to the will. “ ‘to harry james potter,’ ” he read and harry’s insides contracted with a sudden excitement “ ‘i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.’ ” as scrimgeour pulled out the tiny walnut-sized golden ball its silver wings fluttered rather feebly and harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax. “why did dumbledore leave you this snitch?” asked scrimgeour. “no idea,” said harry. “for the reasons you just read out i suppose ... to remind me what you can get if you ... persevere and whatever it was.” “you think this a mere symbolic keepsake then?” “i suppose so,” said harry. “what else could it be?” “i’m asking the questions,” said scrimgeour shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. dusk was really falling outside now the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge. “i notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a snitch,” scrimgeour said to harry. “why is that?” hermione laughed derisively. “oh it can’t be a reference to the fact harry’s a great seeker that’s way too obvious,” she said. “there must be a secret message from dumbledore hidden in the icing!” “i don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said scrimgeour “but a snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. you know why i’m sure?” harry shrugged. hermione however answered harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge. “because snitches have flesh memories,” she said. “what?” said harry and ron together both considered hermione ’s quidditch knowledge negligible. “correct,” said scrimgeour. “a snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released not even by the maker who wears gloves. it carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it in case of a disputed capture. this snitch” — he held up the tiny golden ball — “will remember your touch potter. it occurs to me that dumbledore who had prodigious magical skill whatever his other faults might have enchanted this snitch so that it will open only for you.” harry’s heart was beating rather fast. he was sure that scrimgeour was right. how could he avoid taking the snitch with his bare hand in front of the minister “you don’t say anything,” said scrimgeour. “perhaps you already know what the snitch contains?” “no,” said harry still wondering how he could appear to touch the snitch without really doing so. if only he knew legilimency really knew it and could read hermione’s mind he could practically hear her brain whirring beside him. “take it,” said scrimgeour quietly. harry met the minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. he held out his hand and scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the snitch slowly and deliberately into harry’s palm. nothing happened. as harry’s fingers closed around the snitch its tired wings fluttered and were still. scrimgeour ron and hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball as if still hoping it might transform in some way. “that was dramatic,” said harry coolly. both ron and hermione laughed. “that’s all then is it?” asked hermione making to prise herself off the sofa. “not quite,” said scrimgeour who looked bad tempered now. “dumbledore left you a second bequest potter.” “what is it?” asked harry excitement rekindling. scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. “the sword of godric gryffindor,” he said. hermione and ron both stiffened. harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt but scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch which in any case looked much too small to contain it. “so where is it?” harry asked suspiciously. “unfortunately,” said scrimgeour “that sword was not dumbledore ’s to give away. the sword of godric gryffindor is an important historical artifact and as such belongs — ” “it belongs to harry!” said hermione hotly. “it chose him he was the one who found it it came to him out of the sorting hat — ” “according to reliable historical sources the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor,” said scrimgeour. “that does not make it the exclusive property of mr. potter whatever dumbledore may have decided.” scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek scrutinizing harry. “why do you think — ” “ — dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said harry struggling to keep his temper. “maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.” “this is not a joke potter!” growled scrimgeour. “was it because dumbledore believed that only the sword of godric gryffindor could defeat the heir of slytherin did he wish to give you that sword potter because he believed as do many that you are the one destined to destroy he-who-must-not-be-named?” “interesting theory,” said harry. “has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in voldemort maybe the ministry should put some people onto that instead of wasting their time stripping down deluminators or covering up breakouts from azkaban. so is this what you’ve been doing minister shut up in your office trying to break open a snitch people are dying — i was nearly one of them — voldemort chased me across three counties he killed mad-eye moody but there’s been no word about any of that from the ministry has there and you still expect us to cooperate with you!” “you go too far!” shouted scrimgeour standing up harry jumped to his feet too. scrimgeour limped toward harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand it singed a hole in harry’s t shirt like a lit cigarette. “oi!” said ron jumping up and raising his own wand but harry said “no! d’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?” “remembered you’re not at school have you?” said scrimgeour breathing hard into harry’s face. “remembered that i am not dumbledore who forgave your insolence and insubordination you may wear that scar like a crown potter but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! it’s time you learned some respect!” “it’s time you earned it,” said harry. the floor trembled there was a sound of running footsteps then the door to the sitting room burst open and mr. and mrs. weasley ran in. “we — we thought we heard — ” began mr. weasley looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of harry and the minister virtually nose to nose. “ — raised voices,” panted mrs. weasley. scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from harry glancing at the hole he had made in harry’s t-shirt. he seemed to regret his loss of temper. “it — it was nothing,” he growled. “i ... regret your attitude,” he said looking harry full in the face once more. “you seem to think that the ministry does not desire what you — what dumbledore — desired. we ought to be working together.” “i don’t like your methods minister,” said harry. “remember?” for the second time he raised his right fist and displayed to scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it spelling i must not tell lies. scrimgeour ’s expression hardened. he turned away without another word and limped from the room. mrs. weasley hurried after him harry heard her stop at the back door. after a minute or so she called “he’s gone!” “what did he want?” mr. weasley asked looking around at harry ron and hermione as mrs. weasley came hurrying back to them. “to give us what dumbledore left us,” said harry. “they’ve only just released the contents of his will.” outside in the garden over the dinner tables the three objects scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. everyone exclaimed over the deluminator and the tales of beedle the bard and lamented the fact that scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why dumbledore would have left harry an old snitch. as mr. weasley examined the deluminator for the third or fourth time mrs. weasley said tentatively “harry dear everyone’s awfully hungry we didn’t like to start without you. ... shall i serve dinner now?” they all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of “happy birthday” and much gulping of cake the party broke up. hagrid who was invited to the wedding the following day but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched burrow left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field. “meet us upstairs,” harry whispered to hermione while they helped mrs. weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “after everyone’s gone to bed.” up in the attic room ron examined his deluminator and harry filled hagrid’s mokeskin purse not with gold but with those items he most prized apparently worthless though some of them were the marauder’s map the shard of sirius’s enchanted mirror and r.a.b.’s locket. he pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck then sat holding the old snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. at last hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside. “ muffliato,” she whispered waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. “thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said ron. “times change,” said hermione. “now show us that deluminator.” ron obliged at once. holding it up in front of him he clicked it. the solitary lamp they had lit went out at once. “the thing is,” whispered hermione through the dark “we could have achieved that with peruvian instant darkness powder.” there was a small click and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more. “still it’s cool,” said ron a little defensively. “and from what they said dumbledore invented it himself!” “i know but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!” “d’you think he knew the ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he’d left us?” asked harry. “definitely,” said hermione. “he couldn’t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things but that still doesn’t explain ...” ... why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked ron. “well exactly,” said hermione now flicking through the tales of beedle the bard. “if these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the ministry you’d think he’d have let us know why ... unless he thought it was obvious?” “thought wrong then didn’t he?” said ron. “i always said he was mental. brilliant and everything but cracked. leaving harry an old snitch — what the hell was that about?” “i’ve no idea,” said hermione. “when scrimgeour made you take it harry i was so sure that something was going to happen!” “yeah well,” said harry his pulse quickening as he raised the snitch in his fingers. “i wasn’t going to try too hard in front of scrimgeour was i?” “what do you mean?” asked hermione. “the snitch i caught in my first ever quidditch match?” said harry. “don’t you remember?” hermione looked simply bemused. ron however gasped pointing frantically from harry to the snitch and back again until he found his voice. “that was the one you nearly swallowed!” “exactly,” said harry and with his heart beating fast he pressed his mouth to the snitch. it did not open. frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him he lowered the golden sphere but then hermione cried out. “writing! there’s writing on it quick look!” he nearly dropped the snitch in surprise and excitement. hermione was quite right. engraved upon the smooth golden surface where seconds before there had been nothing were five words written in the thin slanting handwriting that harry recognized as dumbledore’s i open at the close. he had barely read them when the words vanished again. “ ‘i open at the close ...’ what’s that supposed to mean?” hermione and ron shook their heads looking blank. “i open at the close ... at the close ... i open at the close ...” but no matter how often they repeated the words with many different inflections they were unable to wring any more meaning from them. “and the sword,” said ron finally when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the snitch’s inscription. “why did he want harry to have the sword?” “and why couldn’t he just have told me?” harry said quietly. “it was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! if he wanted me to have it why didn’t he just give it to me then?” he felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him his brain slow and unresponsive. was there something he had missed in the long talks with dumbledore last year ought he to know what it all meant had dumbledore expected him to understand “and as for this book,” said hermione “the tales of beedle the bard ... i’ve never even heard of them!” “you’ve never heard of the tales of beedle the bard?” said ron incredulously. “you’re kidding right?” “no i’m not!” said hermione in surprise. “do you know them then?” “well of course i do!” harry looked up diverted. the circumstance of ron having read a book that hermione had not was unprecedented. ron however looked bemused by their surprise. “oh come on! all the old kids’ stories are supposed to be beedle ’s aren’t they the fountain of fair fortune’ ... the wizard and the hopping pot’ ... ‘babbitty rabbitty and her cackling stump’ ...” “excuse me?” said hermione giggling. “what was that last one “come off it!” said ron looking in disbelief from harry to hermione. “you must’ve heard of babbitty rabbitty “ron you know full well harry and i were brought up by muggles!” said hermione. “we didn’t hear stories like that when we were little we heard ‘snow white and the seven dwarfs’ and ‘cinderella’ — ” “what’s that an illness?” asked ron. “so these are children’s stories?” asked hermione bending again over the runes. “yeah,” said ron uncertainly “i mean that’s just what you hear you know that all these old stories came from beedle. i dunno what they’re like in the original versions.” “but i wonder why dumbledore thought i should read them?” something creaked downstairs. “probably just charlie now mum’s asleep sneaking off to regrow his hair,” said ron nervously. “all the same we should get to bed,” whispered hermione. “it wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.” “no,” agreed ron. “a brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. i’ll get the lights.” and he clicked the deluminator once more as hermione left the room. the wedding three o’clock on the following afternoon found harry ron fred and george standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. harry had taken a large dose of polyjuice potion and was now the double of a redheaded muggle boy from the local village ottery st. catchpole from whom fred had stolen hairs using a summoning charm. the plan was to introduce harry as “cousin barny” and trust to the great number of weasley relatives to camouflage him. all four of them were clutching seating plans so that they could help show people to the right seats. a host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier along with a golden-jacketed band and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. behind harry the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. the supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. fred and george had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where bill and fleur would shortly become husband and wife. outside butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. harry was rather uncomfortable. the muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day. “when i get married,” said fred tugging at the collar of his own robes “i won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. you can all wear what you like and i’ll put a full body-bind curse on mum until it’s all over.” “she wasn’t too bad this morning considering,” said george. “cried a bit about percy not being here but who wants him oh blimey brace yourselves — here they come look.” brightly colored figures were appearing one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. within minutes a procession had formed which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches’ hats while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards’ cravats a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. “excellent i think i see a few veela cousins,” said george craning his neck for a better look. “they’ll need help understanding our english customs i’ll look after them. ...” “not so fast your holeyness,” said fred and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession he said “here — permettez-moi to assister vous,” to a pair of pretty french girls who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. george was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and ron took charge of mr. weasley’s old ministry colleague perkins while a rather deaf old couple fell to harry’s lot. “wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found tonks and lupin at the front of the queue. she had turned blonde for the occasion. “arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. sorry about last night,” she added in a whisper as harry led them up the aisle. “the ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.” “it’s fine i understand,” said harry speaking more to lupin than tonks. lupin gave him a swift smile but as they turned away harry saw lupin’s face fall again into lines of misery. he did not understand it but there was no time to dwell on the matter hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. having misunderstood fred’s directions he had sat himself not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. while mr. weasley repaired the damage and hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen harry hurried back to the entrance to find ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. slightly cross eyed with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. an odd symbol rather like a triangular eye glistened from a golden chain around his neck. “xenophilius lovegood,” he said extending a hand to harry “my daughter and i live just over the hill so kind of the good weasleys to invite us. but i think you know my luna?” he added to ron. “yes,” said ron. “isn’t she with you?” “she lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes such a glorious infestation! how few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes — or to give them their correct name the gernumbli gardensi.” “ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said ron “but i think fred and george taught them those.” he led a party of warlocks into the marquee as luna rushed up. “hello harry!” she said. “er — my name’s barny,” said harry flummoxed. “oh have you changed that too?” she asked brightly. “how did you know — ” “oh just your expression,” she said. like her father luna was wearing bright yellow robes which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. once you got over the brightness of it all the general effect was quite pleasant. at least there were no radishes dangling from her ears. xenophilius who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance had missed the exchange between luna and harry. bidding the wizard farewell he turned to his daughter who held up her finger and said “daddy look — one of the gnomes actually bit me!” “how wonderful! gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!” said mr. lovegood seizing luna’s outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks. “luna my love if you should feel any burgeoning talent today — perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in mermish — do not repress it! you may have been gifted by the gernumblies!” ron passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort. “ron can laugh,” said luna serenely as harry led her and xenophilius toward their seats “but my father has done a lot of research on gernumbli magic.” “really?” said harry who had long since decided not to challenge luna or her father’s peculiar views. “are you sure you don’t want to put anything on that bite though?” “oh it’s fine,” said luna sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking harry up and down. “you look smart. i told daddy most people would probably wear dress robes but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding for luck you know.” as she drifted off after her father ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. her beaky nose red-rimmed eyes and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo. ... and your hair’s much too long ronald for a moment i thought you were ginevra. merlin’s beard what is xenophilius lovegood wearing he looks like an omelet. and who are you?” she barked at harry. “oh yeah auntie muriel this is our cousin barny.” “another weasley you breed like gnomes. isn’t harry potter here i was hoping to meet him. i thought he was a friend of yours ronald or have you merely been boasting?” “no — he couldn’t come — ” “hmm. made an excuse did he not as gormless as he looks in press photographs then. i’ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,” she shouted at harry. “goblin-made you know and been in my family for centuries. she’s a good-looking girl but still — french. well well find me a good seat ronald i am a hundred and seven and i ought not to be on my feet too long.” ron gave harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time when next they met at the entrance harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. the marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside. “nightmare muriel is,” said ron mopping his forehead on his sleeve. “she used to come for christmas every year then thank god she took offense because fred and george set off a dung-bomb under her chair at dinner. dad always says she’ll have written them out of her will — like they care they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the family rate they’re going. ... wow,” he added blinking rather rapidly as hermione came hurrying toward them. “you look great!” “always the tone of surprise,” said hermione though she smiled. she was wearing a floaty lilac-colored dress with matching high heels her hair was sleek and shiny. “your great-aunt muriel doesn’t agree i just met her upstairs while she was giving fleur the tiara. she said ‘oh dear is this the muggle-born?’ and then ‘bad posture and skinny ankles.’ ” “don’t take it personally she’s rude to everyone,” said ron. “talking about muriel?” inquired george reemerging from the marquee with fred. “yeah she’s just told me my ears are lopsided. old bat. i wish old uncle bilius was still with us though he was a right laugh at weddings.” “wasn’t he the one who saw a grim and died twenty four hours later?” asked hermione. “well yeah he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded george. “but before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,” said fred. “he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky then run onto the dance floor hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his — ” “yes he sounds a real charmer,” said hermione while harry roared with laughter. “never married for some reason,” said ron. “you amaze me,” said hermione. they were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer a dark-haired young man with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows until he held out his invitation to ron and said with his eyes on hermione “you look vunderful.” “viktor!” she shrieked and dropped her small beaded bag which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. as she scrambled blushing to pick it up she said “i didn’t know you were — goodness — it’s lovely to see — how are you?” ron’s ears had turned bright red again. after glancing at krum’s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it he said much too loudly “how come you’re here?” “fleur invited me,” said krum eyebrows raised. harry who had no grudge against krum shook hands then feeling that it would be prudent to remove krum from ron’s vicinity offered to show him his seat. “your friend is not pleased to see me,” said krum as they entered the now packed marquee. “or is he a relative?” he added with a glance at harry’s red curly hair. “cousin,” harry muttered but krum was not really listening. his appearance was causing a stir particularly amongst the veela cousins he was after all a famous quidditch player. while people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him ron hermione fred and george came hurrying down the aisle. “time to sit down,” fred told harry “or we’re going to get run over by the bride.” harry ron and hermione took their seats in the second row behind fred and george. hermione looked rather pink and ron’s ears were still scarlet. after a few moments he muttered to harry “did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?” harry gave a noncommittal grunt. a sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. mr. and mrs. weasley strolled up the aisle smiling and waving at relatives mrs. weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-colored robes with a matching hat. a moment later bill and charlie stood up at the front of the marquee both wearing dress robes with large white roses in their buttonholes fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. “ooooh!” said hermione swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. a great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as monsieur delacour and fleur came walking up the aisle fleur gliding monsieur delacour bouncing and beaming. fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong silvery glow. while her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison today it beautified everybody it fell upon. ginny and gabrielle both wearing golden dresses looked even prettier than usual and once fleur had reached him bill did not look as though he had ever met fenrir greyback. “ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice and with a slight shock harry saw the same small tufty-haired wizard who had presided at dumbledore’s funeral now standing in front of bill and fleur. “we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls ...” “yes my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said auntie muriel in a rather carrying whisper. “but i must say ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” ginny glanced around grinning winked at harry then quickly faced the front again. harry’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee back to afternoons spent alone with ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. they seemed so long ago they had always seemed too good to be true as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person’s life a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. ... “do you william arthur take fleur isabelle ... ” in the front row mrs. weasley and madame delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. hermione turned and beamed at harry her eyes too were full of tears. ... then i declare you bonded for life.” the tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of bill and fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them spiraling around their now entwined figures. as fred and george led a round of applause the golden balloons overhead burst birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them adding their songs and chimes to the din. “ladies and gentlemen!” called the tufty-haired wizard. “if you would please stand up!” they all did so auntie muriel grumbling audibly he waved his wand again. the seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. next a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small white-clothed tables which all floated gracefully back to earth around it and the golden jacketed band trooped toward a podium. “smooth,” said ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice butterbeer and firewhisky others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. “we should go and congratulate them!” said hermione standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well wishers. “well have time later,” shrugged ron snatching three butter-beers from a passing tray and handing one to harry. “hermione cop hold let’s grab a table. ... not there! nowhere near muriel — ” ron led the way across the empty dance floor glancing left and right as he went harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for krum. by the time they had reached the other side of the marquee most of the tables were occupied the emptiest was the one where luna sat alone. “all right if we join you?” asked ron. “oh yes,” she said happily. “daddy’s just gone to give bill and fleur our present.” “what is it a lifetime’s supply of gurdyroots?” asked ron. hermione aimed a kick at him under the table but caught harry instead. eyes watering in pain harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. the band had begun to play. bill and fleur took to the dance floor first to great applause after a while mr. weasley led madame delacour onto the floor followed by mrs. weasley and fleur’s father. “i like this song,” said luna swaying in time to the waltzlike tune and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor where she revolved on the spot quite alone eyes closed and waving her arms. “she’s great isn’t she?” said ron admiringly. “always good value.” but the smile vanished from his face at once viktor krum had dropped into luna’s vacant seat. hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time krum had not come to compliment her. with a scowl on his face he said “who is that man in the yellow?” “that’s xenophilius lovegood he’s the father of a friend of ours,” said ron. his pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at xenophilius despite the clear provocation. “come and dance,” he added abruptly to hermione. she looked taken aback but pleased too and got up. they vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor. “ah they are together now?” asked krum momentarily distracted. “er — sort of,” said harry. “who are you?” krum asked. “barny weasley.” they shook hands. “you barny — you know this man lovegood veil?” “no i only met him today. why?” krum glowered over the top of his drink watching xenophilius who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. “because,” said krum “if he vos not a guest of fleur’s i vould duel him here and now for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.” “sign?” said harry looking over at xenophilius too. the strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. “why what’s wrong with it?” “grindelvald. that is grindelvald’s sign.” “grindelwald . . . the dark wizard dumbledore defeated?” “exactly.” krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing then he said “grindelvald killed many people my grandfather for instance. of course he vos never poverful in this country they said he feared dumbledore — and rightly seeing how he vos finished. but this” — he pointed a finger at xenophilius — “this is his symbol i recognized it at vunce grindelvald carved it into a vail at durmstrang ven he vos a pupil there. some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock make themselves impressive — until those of us who had lost family members to grindelvald taught them better.” krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at xenophilius. harry felt perplexed. it seemed incredibly unlikely that luna’s father was a supporter of the dark arts and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular runelike shape. “are you — er — quite sure it’s grindelwald’s — ” “i am not mistaken,” said krum coldly. “i valked past that sign for several years i know it veil.” “well there’s a chance,” said harry “that xenophilius doesn’t actually know what the symbol means. the lovegoods are quite ... unusual. he could easily have picked it up somewhere and think it’s a cross section of the head of a crumple-horned snorkack or something.” “the cross section of a vot?” “well i don’t know what they are but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them. ...” harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining luna and her father. “that’s her,” he said pointing at luna who was still dancing alone waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges. “vy is she doing that?” asked krum. “probably trying to get rid of a wrackspurt,” said harry who recognized the symptoms. krum did not seem to know whether or not harry was making fun of him. he drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh sparks flew out of the end. “gregorovitch!” said harry loudly and krum started but harry was too excited to care the memory had come back to him at the sight of krum’s wand ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the triwizard tournament. “vot about him?” asked krum suspiciously. “he’s a wandmaker!” “i know that,” said krum. “he made your wand! that’s why i thought — quidditch — ” krum was looking more and more suspicious. “how do you know gregorovitch made my vand?” “i ... i read it somewhere i think,” said harry. “in a — a fan magazine,” he improvised wildly and krum looked mollified. “i had not realized i ever discussed my vand with fans,” he said. “so ... er ... where is gregorovitch these days?” krum looked puzzled. “he retired several years ago. i vos one of the last to purchase a gregorovitch vand. they are the best — although i know of course that you britons set much store by ollivander.” harry did not answer. he pretended to watch the dancers like krum but he was thinking hard. so voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and harry did not have to search far for a reason it was surely because of what harry’s wand had done on the night that voldemort had pursued him across the skies. the holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand something that ollivander had not anticipated or understood. would gregorovitch know better was he truly more skilled than ollivander did he know secrets of wands that ollivander did not “this girl is very nice-looking,” krum said recalling harry to his surroundings. krum was pointing at ginny who had just joined luna. “she is also a relative of yours?” “yeah,” said harry suddenly irritated “and she’s seeing someone. jealous type. big bloke. you wouldn’t want to cross him.” krum grunted. “vot,” he said draining his goblet and getting to his feet again “is the point of being an international quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?” and he strode off leaving harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. he wanted to find ron to tell him about gregorovitch but ron was dancing with hermione out in the middle of the floor. harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched ginny who was now dancing with fred and george’s friend lee jordan trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given ron. he had never been to a wedding before so he could not judge how wizarding celebrations differed from muggle ones though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. as evening drew in and moths began to swoop under the canopy now lit with floating golden lanterns the revelry became more and more uncontained. fred and george had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of fleur’s cousins charlie hagrid and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing “odo the hero” in a corner. wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not harry was his son harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. his cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. he was vaguely familiar racking his brains harry suddenly realized that this was elphias doge member of the order of the phoenix and the writer of dumbledore’s obituary. harry approached him. “may i sit down?” “of course of course,” said doge he had a rather high-pitched wheezy voice. harry leaned in. “mr. doge i’m harry potter.” doge gasped. “my dear boy! arthur told me you were here disguised. ... i am so glad so honored!” in a flutter of nervous pleasure doge poured harry a goblet of champagne. “i thought of writing to you,” he whispered “after dumbledore ... the shock ... and for you i am sure doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. “i saw the obituary you wrote for the daily prophet,” said harry. “i didn’t realize you knew professor dumbledore so well.” “as well as anyone,” said doge dabbing his eyes with a napkin. “certainly i knew him longest if you don’t count aberforth — and somehow people never do seem to count aberforth.” “speaking of the daily prophet ... i don’t know whether you saw mr. doge — ” “oh please call me elphias dear boy.” “elphias i don’t know whether you saw the interview rita skeeter gave about dumbledore?” doge’s face flooded with angry color. “oh yes harry i saw it. that woman or vulture might be a more accurate term positively pestered me to talk to her. i am ashamed to say that i became rather rude called her an interfering trout which resulted as you may have seen in aspersions cast upon my sanity.” “well in that interview,” harry went on “rita skeeter hinted that professor dumbledore was involved in the dark arts when he was young.” “don’t believe a word of it!” said doge at once. “not a word harry! let nothing tarnish your memories of albus dumbledore!” harry looked into doge’s earnest pained face and felt not reassured but frustrated. did doge really think it was that easy that harry could simply choose not to believe didn’t doge understand harry’s need to be sure to know everything perhaps doge suspected harry’s feelings for he looked concerned and hurried on “harry rita skeeter is a dreadful — ” but he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. “rita skeeter oh i love her always read her!” harry and doge looked up to see auntie muriel standing there the plumes dancing on her hat a goblet of champagne in her hand. “she’s written a book about dumbledore you know!” “hello muriel,” said doge. “yes we were just discussing — ” “you there! give me your chair i’m a hundred and seven!” another redheaded weasley cousin jumped off his seat looking alarmed and auntie muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between doge and harry. “hello again barry or whatever your name is,” she said to harry. “now what were you saying about rita skeeter elphias you know she’s written a biography of dumbledore i can’t wait to read it i must remember to place an order at flourish and blotts!” doge looked stiff and solemn at this but auntie muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. she took another large gulp of champagne belched and then said “there’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh there were some mighty funny rumors about albus!” “ill-informed sniping,” said doge turning radish colored again. “you would say that elphias,” cackled auntie muriel. “i noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!” “i’m sorry you think so,” said doge more coldly still. “i assure you i was writing from the heart.” “oh we all know you worshipped dumbledore i daresay you’ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his squib sister!” “muriell” exclaimed doge. a chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through harry’s chest. “what do you mean?” he asked muriel. “who said his sister was a squib i thought she was ill?” “thought wrong then didn’t you barry!” said auntie muriel looking delighted at the effect she had produced. “anyway how could you expect to know anything about it it all happened years and years before you were even thought of my dear and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. that’s why i can’t wait to find out what skeeter’s unearthed! dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!” “untrue!” wheezed doge. “absolutely untrue!” “he never told me his sister was a squib,” said harry without thinking still cold inside. “and why on earth would he tell you?” screeched muriel swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon harry. “the reason albus never spoke about ariana,” began elphias in a voice stiff with emotion “is i should have thought quite clear. he was so devastated by her death — ” “why did nobody ever see her elphias?” squawked muriel. “why did half of us never even know she existed until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her where was saintly albus while ariana was locked in the cellar off being brilliant at hogwarts and never mind what was going on in his own house!” “what d’you mean locked in the cellar?” asked harry. “what is this?” doge looked wretched. auntie muriel cackled again and answered harry. “dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman simply terrifying. muggle-born though i heard she pretended otherwise — ” “she never pretended anything of the sort! kendra was a fine woman,” whispered doge miserably but auntie muriel ignored him. “ — proud and very domineering the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a squib — ” “ariana was not a squib!” wheezed doge. “so you say elphias but explain then why she never attended hogwarts!” said auntie muriel. she turned back to harry. “in our day squibs were often hushed up though to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn’t exist — ” “i tell you that’s not what happened!” said doge but auntie muriel steamrollered on still addressing harry. “squibs were usually shipped off to muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the muggle community . . . much kinder than trying to find them a place in the wizarding world where they must always be second class but naturally kendra dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a muggle school — ” “ariana was delicate!” said doge desperately. “her health was always too poor to permit her — ” “ — to permit her to leave the house?” cackled muriel. “and yet she was never taken to st. mungo’s and no healer was ever summoned to see her!” “really muriel how you can possibly know whether “for your information elphias my cousin lancelot was a healer at st. mungo’s at the time and he told my family in strictest confidence that ariana had never been seen there. all most suspicious lancelot thought!” doge looked to be on the verge of tears. auntie muriel who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely snapped her fingers for more champagne. numbly harry thought of how the dursleys had once shut him up locked him away kept him out of sight all for the crime of being a wizard. had dumbledore’s sister suffered the same fate in reverse imprisoned for her lack of magic and had dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented “now if kendra hadn’t died first,” muriel resumed “i’d have said that it was she who finished off ariana “how can you muriel?” groaned doge. “a mother kill her own daughter think what you are saying!” “if the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end why not?” shrugged auntie muriel. “but as i say it doesn’t fit because kendra died before ariana — of what nobody ever seemed sure — ” “oh no doubt ariana murdered her,” said doge with a brave attempt at scorn. “why not?” “yes ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed kendra in the struggle,” said auntie muriel thoughtfully. “shake your head all you like elphias! you were at ariana’s funeral were you not?” “yes i was,” said doge through trembling lips. “and a more desperately sad occasion i cannot remember. albus was heartbroken — ” “his heart wasn’t the only thing. didn’t aberforth break albus ’s nose halfway through the service?” if doge had looked horrified before this it was nothing to how he looked now. muriel might have stabbed him. she cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne which dribbled down her chin. “how do you — ” croaked doge. “my mother was friendly with old bathilda bagshot,” said auntie muriel happily. “bathilda described the whole thing to mother while i was listening at the door. a coffin-side brawl! the way bathilda told it aberforth shouted that it was all albus ’s fault that ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. according to bathilda albus did not even defend himself and that’s odd enough in itself albus could have destroyed aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back.” muriel swigged yet more champagne. the recitation of these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified doge. harry did not know what to think what to believe he wanted the truth and yet all doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that ariana had been ill. harry could hardly believe that dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story. “and i’ll tell you something else,” muriel said hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet. “i think bathilda has spilled the beans to rita skeeter. all those hints in skeeter’s interview about an important source close to the dumbledores — goodness knows she was there all through the ariana business and it would fit!” “bathilda would never talk to rita skeeter!” whispered doge. “bathilda bagshot?” harry said. “the author of a history of magic?” the name was printed on the front of one of harry’s textbooks though admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively. “yes,” said doge clutching at harry’s question like a drowning man at a life belt. “a most gifted magical historian and an old friend of albus’s.” “quite gaga these days i’ve heard,” said auntie muriel cheerfully. “if that is so it is even more dishonorable for skeeter to have taken advantage of her,” said doge “and no reliance can be placed on anything bathilda may have said!” “oh there are ways of bringing back memories and i’m sure rita skeeter knows them all,” said auntie muriel. “but even if bathilda’s completely cuckoo i’m sure she’d still have old photographs maybe even letters. she knew the dumbledores for years. ... well worth a trip to godric’s hollow i’d have thought.” harry who had been taking a sip of butterbeer choked. doge banged him on the back as harry coughed looking at auntie muriel through streaming eyes. once he had control of his voice again he asked “bathilda bagshot lives in godric’s hollow?” “oh yes she’s been there forever! the dumbledores moved there after percival was imprisoned and she was their neighbor.” “the dumbledores lived in godric’s hollow?” “yes barry that’s what i just said,” said auntie muriel testily. harry felt drained empty. never once in six years had dumbledore told harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in godric’s hollow. why were lily and james buried close to dumbledore ’s mother and sister had dumbledore visited their graves perhaps walked past lily’s and james’s to do so and he had never once told harry . . . never bothered to say and why it was so important harry could not explain even to himself yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. he stared ahead of him barely noticing what was going on around him and did not realize that hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. “i simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted slipping off one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. “ron’s gone looking to find more butterbeers. it’s a bit odd i’ve just seen viktor storming away from luna’s father it looked like they’d been arguing — ” she dropped her voice staring at him. “harry are you okay?” harry did not know where to begin but it did not matter. at that moment something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. graceful and gleaming the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. heads turned as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. then the patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud deep slow voice of kingsley shacklebolt. “the ministry has fallen. scrimgeour is dead. they are coming.” 9 a place to hide everything seemed fuzzy slow. harry and hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands. many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the patronus had landed. then somebody screamed. harry and hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. guests were sprinting in all directions many were disapparating the protective enchantments around the burrow had broken. “ron!” hermione cried. “ron where are you?” as they pushed their way across the dance floor harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd then he saw lupin and tonks their wands raised and heard both of them shout “protego\” a cry that was echoed on all sides — “ron! ron!” hermione called half sobbing as she and harry were buffeted by terrified guests harry seized her hand to make sure they weren’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know — and then ron was there. he caught hold of hermione ’s free arm and harry felt her turn on the spot sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him all he could feel was hermione’s hand as he was squeezed through space and time away from the burrow away from the descending death eaters away perhaps from voldemort himself. ... “where are we?” said ron’s voice. harry opened his eyes. for a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all they still seemed to be surrounded by people. “tottenham court road,” panted hermione. “walk just walk we need to find somewhere for you to change.” harry did as she asked. they half walked half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops stars twinkling above them. a double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed harry and ron were still wearing dress robes. “hermione we haven’t got anything to change into,” ron told her as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him. “why didn’t i make sure i had the invisibility cloak with me?” said harry inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “all last year i kept it on me and — ” “it’s okay i’ve got the cloak i’ve got clothes for both of you,” said hermione. “just try and act naturally until — this will do.” she led them down a side street then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. “when you say you’ve got the cloak and clothes ...” said harry frowning at hermione who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag in which she was now rummaging. “yes they’re here,” said hermione and to harry and ron’s utter astonishment she pulled out a pair of jeans a sweatshirt some maroon socks and finally the silvery invisibility cloak. “how the ruddy hell — ” “undetectable extension charm,” said hermione. “tricky but i think i’ve done it okay anyway i managed to fit everything we need in here.” she gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. “oh damn that’ll be the books,” she said peering into it “and i had them all stacked by subject. ... oh well. ... harry you’d better take the invisibility cloak. ron hurry up and change. ...” “when did you do all this?” harry asked as ron stripped off his robes. “i told you at the burrow i’ve had the essentials packed for days you know in case we needed to make a quick getaway. i packed your rucksack this morning harry after you changed and put it in here. ... i just had a feeling. ...” “you’re amazing you are,” said ron handing her his bundled-up robes. “thank you,” said hermione managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. “please harry get that cloak on!” harry threw the invisibility cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head vanishing from sight. he was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened. “the others — everyone at the wedding — ” “we can’t worry about that now,” whispered hermione. “it’s you they’re after harry and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.” “she’s right,” said ron who seemed to know that harry was about to argue even if he could not see his face. “most of the order was there they’ll look after everyone.” harry nodded then remembered that they could not see him and said “yeah.” but he thought of ginny and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach. “come on i think we ought to keep moving,” said hermione. they moved back up the side street and onto the main road again where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement. “just as a matter of interest why tottenham court road?” ron asked hermione. “i’ve no idea it just popped into my head but i’m sure we’re safer out in the muggle world it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.” “true,” said ron looking around “but don’t you feel a bit — exposed?” “where else is there?” asked hermione cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf whistling at her. “we can hardly book rooms at the leaky cauldron can we and grimmauld place is out if snape can get in there. ... i suppose we could try my parents’ house though i think there’s a chance they might check there. ... oh i wish they’d shut up!” “all right darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. “fancy a drink ditch ginger and come and have a pint!” “let’s sit down somewhere,” hermione said hastily as ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. “look this will do in here!” it was a small and shabby all-night cafe. a light layer of grease lay on all the formica topped tables but it was at least empty. harry slipped into a booth first and ron sat next to him opposite hermione who had her back to the entrance and did not like it she glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. harry did not like being stationary walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. beneath the cloak he could feel the last vestiges of polyjuice leaving him his hands returning to their usual length and shape. he pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again. after a minute or two ron said “you know we’re not far from the leaky cauldron here it’s only in charing cross — ” “ron we can’t!” said hermione at once. “not to stay there but to find out what’s going on!” “we know what’s going on! voldemort’s taken over the ministry what else do we need to know?” “okay okay it was just an idea!” they relapsed into a prickly silence. the gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and hermione ordered two cappuccinos as harry was invisible it would have looked odd to order him one. a pair of burly workmen entered the cafe and squeezed into the next booth. hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. “i say we find a quiet place to disapparate and head for the countryside. once we’re there we could send a message to the order.” “can you do that talking patronus thing then?” asked ron. “i’ve been practicing and i think so,” said hermione. “well as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble though they might’ve been arrested already. god that’s revolting,” ron added after one sip of the foamy grayish coffee. the waitress had heard she shot ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers’ orders. the larger of the two workmen who was blond and quite huge now that harry came to look at him waved her away. she stared affronted. “let’s get going then i don’t want to drink this muck,” said ron. “hermione have you got muggle money to pay for this?” “yes i took out all my building society savings before i came to the burrow. i’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed hermione reaching for her beaded bag. the two workmen made identical movements and harry mirrored them without conscious thought all three of them drew their wands. ron a few seconds late in realizing what was going on lunged across the table pushing hermione sideways onto her bench. the force of the death eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall where ron’s head had just been as harry still invisible yelled “stupefyl” the great blond death eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light he slumped sideways unconscious. his companion unable to see who had cast the spell fired another at ron shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door — harry sent another stunning spell at the death eater with the twisted face who had tied up ron but the spell missed rebounded on the window and hit the waitress who collapsed in front of the door. “expulsol” bellowed the death eater and the table behind which harry was standing blew up the force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the cloak slipped off him. “petrificus totalusv’ screamed hermione from out of sight and the death eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china table and coffee. hermione crawled out from underneath the bench shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over. “d-diffindo,” she said pointing her wand at ron who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans leaving a deep cut. “oh i’m so sorry ron my hand’s shaking! diffindol” the severed ropes fell away. ron got to his feet shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond death eater was sprawled across the bench. “i should’ve recognized him he was there the night dumbledore died,” he said. he turned over the darker death eater with his foot the man’s eyes moved rapidly between harry ron and hermione. “that’s dolohov,” said ron. “i recognize him from the old wanted posters. i think the big one’s thorfinn rowle.” “never mind what they’re called!” said hermione a little hysterically. “how did they find us what are we going to do?” somehow her panic seemed to clear harry’s head. “lock the door,” he told her “and ron turn out the lights.” he looked down at the paralyzed dolohov thinking fast as the lock clicked and ron used the deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness. harry could hear the men who had jeered at hermione earlier yelling at another girl in the distance. “what are we going to do with them?” ron whispered to harry through the dark then even more quietly “kill them they’d kill us. they had a good go just now.” hermione shuddered and took a step backward. harry shook his head. “we just need to wipe their memories,” said harry. “it’s better like that it’ll throw them off the scent. if we killed them it’d be obvious we were here.” “you’re the boss,” said ron sounding profoundly relieved. “but i’ve never done a memory charm.” “nor have i,” said hermione “but i know the theory.” she took a deep calming breath then pointed her wand at dolohov’s forehead and said “obliviate.” at once dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. “brilliant!” said harry clapping her on the back. “take care of the other one and the waitress while ron and i clear up.” “clear up?” said ron looking around at the partly destroyed cafe. “why?” “don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been bombed?” “oh right yeah ...” ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket. “it’s no wonder i can’t get it out hermione you packed my old jeans they’re tight.” “oh i’m so sorry,” hissed hermione and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where ron could stick his wand instead. once the cafe was restored to its previous condition they heaved the death eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other. “but how did they find us?” hermione asked looking from one inert man to the other. “how did they know where we were?” she turned to harry. “you — you don’t think you’ve still got your trace on you do you harry?” “he can’t have,” said ron. “the trace breaks at seventeen that’s wizarding law you can’t put it on an adult.” “as far as you know,” said hermione. “what if the death eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?” “but harry hasn’t been near a death eater in the last twenty-four hours. who’s supposed to have put a trace back on him?” hermione did not reply. harry felt contaminated tainted was that really how the death eaters had found them “if i can’t use magic and you can’t use magic near me without us giving away our position — ” he began. “we’re not splitting up!” said hermione firmly. “we need a safe place to hide,” said ron. “give us time to think things through.” “grimmauld place,” said harry. the other two gaped. “don’t be silly harry snape can get in there!” “ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him — and even if they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as hermione began to argue “so what i swear i’d like nothing better than to meet snape!” “but — ” “hermione where else is there it’s the best chance we’ve got. snape’s only one death eater. if i’ve still got the trace on me we’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.” she could not argue though she looked as if she would have liked to. while she unlocked the cafe door ron clicked the deluminator to release the cafe’s light. then on harry’s count of three they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the death eaters could do more than stir sleepily harry ron and hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more. seconds later harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. tall dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. number twelve was visible to them for they had been told of its existence by dumbledore its secret keeper and they rushed toward it checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. they raced up the stone steps and harry tapped the front door once with his wand. they heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold. as harry closed the door behind them the old fashioned gas lamps sprang into life casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. it looked just as harry remembered it eerie cobwebbed the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. long dark curtains concealed the portrait of sirius’s mother. the only thing that was out of place was the troll’s leg umbrella stand which was lying on its side as if tonks had just knocked it over again. “i think somebody’s been in here,” hermione whispered pointing toward it. “that could’ve happened as the order left,” ron murmured back. “so where are these jinxes they put up against snape?” harry asked. “maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested ron. yet they remained close together on the doormat backs against the door scared to move farther into the house. “well we can’t stay here forever,” said harry and he took a step forward. “severus snape?” mad-eye moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness making all three of them jump back in fright. “we’re not snape!” croaked harry before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself making it impossible to speak. before he had time to feel inside his mouth however his tongue had unraveled again. the other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. ron was making retching noises hermione stammered “that m-must have b been the t-tongue-tying curse mad-eye set up for snape!” gingerly harry took another step forward. something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall and before any of them could say another word a figure had risen up out of the carpet tall dust-colored and terrible hermione screamed and so did mrs. black her curtains flying open the gray figure was gliding toward them faster and faster its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it its face sunken fleshless with empty eye sockets horribly familiar dreadfully altered it raised a wasted arm pointing at harry. “no!” harry shouted and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. “no! it wasn’t us! we didn’t kill you — ” on the word kill the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust coughing his eyes watering harry looked around to see hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and ron who was shaking from head to foot patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying “it’s all r-right. ... it’s g-gone. ...” dust swirled around harry like mist catching the blue gaslight as mrs. black continued to scream. “mudbloods filth stains of dishonor taint of shame on the house of my fathers — ” “shut up!” harry bellowed directing his wand at her and with a bang and a burst of red sparks the curtains swung shut again silencing her. “that ... that was ...” hermione whimpered as ron helped her to her feet. “yeah,” said harry “but it wasn’t really him was it just something to scare snape.” had it worked harry wondered or had snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real dumbledore nerves still tingling he led the other two up the hall half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. “before we go any farther i think we’d better check,” whispered hermione and she raised her wand and said “homenum revelio.” nothing happened. “well you’ve just had a big shock,” said ron kindly. “what was that supposed to do?” “it did what i meant it to do!” said hermione rather crossly. “that was a spell to reveal human presence and there’s nobody here except us!” “and old dusty,” said ron glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen. “let’s go up,” said hermione with a frightened look at the same spot and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps then shivering slightly in the drafty room she perched on the sofa her arms wrapped tightly around her. ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch. “can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “and you’d think if harry still had a trace on him they’d have followed us here. i know they can’t get in the house but — what’s up harry?” harry had given a cry of pain his scar had burned again as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. he saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body violent and brief as an electric shock. “what did you see?” ron asked advancing on harry. “did you see him at my place?” “no i just felt anger — he’s really angry — ” “but that could be at the burrow,” said ron loudly. “what else didn’t you see anything was he cursing someone?” “no i just felt anger — i couldn’t tell — ” harry felt badgered confused and hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice “your scar again but what’s going on i thought that connection had closed!” “it did for a while,” muttered harry his scar was still painful which made it hard to concentrate. “i — i think it’s started opening again whenever he loses control that’s how it used to — ” “but then you’ve got to close your mind!” said hermione shrilly. “harry dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down that’s why you were supposed to use occlumency! otherwise voldemort can plant false images in your mind remember — ” “yeah i do remember thanks,” said harry through gritted teeth he did not need hermione to tell him that voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap nor that it had resulted in sirius’s death. he wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt it made voldemort more threatening as though he were pressing against the window of the room and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it it was like resisting the urge to be sick. he turned his back on ron and hermione pretending to examine the old tapestry of the black family tree on the wall. then hermione shrieked harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of ron’s father. “family safe do not reply we are being watched.” the patronus dissolved into nothingness. ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa hermione joined him gripping his arm. “they’re all right they’re all right!” she whispered and ron half laughed and hugged her. “harry,” he said over hermione’s shoulder “i — ” “it’s not a problem,” said harry sickened by the pain in his head. “it’s your family ’course you’re worried. i’d feel the same way.” he thought of ginny. “i do feel the same way.” the pain in his scar was reaching a peak burning as it had done in the garden of the burrow. faintly he heard hermione say “i don’t want to be on my own. could we use the sleeping bags i’ve brought and camp in here tonight?” he heard ron agree. he could not fight the pain much longer he had to succumb. “bathroom,” he muttered and he left the room as fast as he could without running. he barely made it bolting the door behind him with trembling hands he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor then in an explosion of agony he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul saw a long room lit only by firelight and the great blond death eater on the floor screaming and writhing and a slighter figure standing over him wand outstretched while harry spoke in a high cold merciless voice. “more rowle or shall we end it and feed you to nagini lord voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. ... you called me back for this to tell me that harry potter has escaped again draco give rowle another taste of our displeasure. ... do it or feel my wrath yourself!” a log fell in the fire flames reared their light darting across a terrified pointed white face — with a sense of emerging from deep water harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. he was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. he sat up. malfoy’s gaunt petrified face seemed branded on the inside of his eyes. harry felt sickened by what he had seen by the use to which draco was now being put by voldemort. there was a sharp rap on the door and harry jumped as hermione’s voice rang out. “harry do you want your toothbrush i’ve got it here.” “yeah great thanks,” he said fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in. 10 kreacher’s tale harry woke early next morning wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor. a chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains it was the cool clear blue of watered ink somewhere between night and dawn and everything was quiet except for ron and hermione’s slow deep breathing. harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa so that her silhouette was raised above his. her arm curved to the floor her fingers inches from ron’s. harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. the idea made him feel strangely lonely. he looked up at the shadowy ceiling the cobwebbed chandelier. less than twenty-four hours ago he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee waiting to show in wedding guests. it seemed a lifetime away. what was going to happen now he lay on the floor and he thought of the horcruxes of the daunting complex mission dumbledore had left him. ... dumbledore ... the grief that had possessed him since dumbledore’s death felt different now. the accusations he had heard from muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. could dumbledore have let such things happen had he been like dudley content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden harry thought of godric’s hollow of graves dumbledore had never mentioned there he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in dumbledore’s will and resentment swelled in the darkness. why hadn’t dumbledore told him why hadn’t he explained had dumbledore actually cared about harry at all or had harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed but not trusted never confided in harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. desperate for something to do for distraction he slipped out of his sleeping bag picked up his wand and crept out of the room. on the landing he whispered “lumos,” and started to climb the stairs by wandlight. on the second landing was the bedroom in which he and ron had slept last time they had been here he glanced into it. the wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back. harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. somebody had searched the house since the order had left. snape or perhaps mundungus who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after sirius died harry’s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained phineas nigellus black sirius’s great-great-grandfather but it was empty showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. phineas nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster’s study at hogwarts. harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors. the one facing him bore a nameplate reading sirius. harry had never entered his godfather’s bedroom before. he pushed open the door holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible. the room was spacious and must once have been handsome. there was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle stubs still resting in its sockets solid wax hanging in frostlike drips. a fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s headboard a spider’s web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe and as harry moved deeper into the room he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice. the teenage sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls’ silvery-gray silk was visible. harry could only assume that sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the permanent sticking charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son’s taste in decoration. sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy his parents. there were several large gryffindor banners faded scarlet and gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the slytherin family. there were many pictures of muggle motorcycles and also harry had to admire sirius’s nerve several posters of bikini-clad muggle girls harry could tell that they were muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. this was in contrast to the only wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four hogwarts students standing arm in arm laughing at the camera. with a leap of pleasure harry recognized his father his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like harry’s and he too wore glasses. beside him was sirius carelessly handsome his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than harry had ever seen it alive. to sirius’s right stood pettigrew more than a head shorter plump and watery-eyed flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs with the much-admired rebels that james and sirius had been. on james’s left was lupin even then a little shabby-looking but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included ... or was it simply because harry knew how it had been that he saw these things in the picture he tried to take it from the wall it was his now after all sirius had left him everything but it would not budge. sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room. harry looked around at the floor. the sky outside was growing brighter a shaft of light revealed bits of paper books and small objects scattered over the carpet. evidently sirius’s bedroom had been searched too although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly if not entirely worthless. a few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with their covers and sundry pages littered the floor. harry bent down picked up a few of the pieces of paper and examined them. he recognized one as part of an old edition of a history of magic by bathilda bagshot and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. the third was handwritten and crumpled. he smoothed it out. dear padfoot thank you thank you for harry’s birthday present! it was his favorite by far. one year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick he looked so pleased with himself i’m enclosing a picture so you can see. you know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase petunia sent me for christmas no complaints there). of course james thought it was so funny says he’s going to be a great quidditch player but we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don’t take our eyes off him when he gets going. we had a very quiet birthday tea just us and old bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on harry. we were so sorry you couldn’t come but the order’s got to come first and harry’s not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway! james is getting a bit frustrated shut up here he tries not to show it but i can tell — also dumbledore’s still got his invisibility cloak so no chance of little excursions. if you could visit it would cheer him up so much. wormy was here last weekend i thought he seemed down but that was probably the news about the mckinnons i cried all evening when i heard. bathilda drops in most days she’s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about dumbledore i’m not sure he’d be pleased if he knew! i don’t know how much to believe actually because it seems incredible that dumbledore harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. he stood quite still holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal measure through his veins. lurching to the bed he sat down. he read the letter again but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. she had made her “g”s the same way he did he searched through the letter for every one of them and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. the letter was an incredible treasure proof that lily potter had lived really lived that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment tracing ink into these letters these words words about him harry her son. impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes he reread the letter this time concentrating on the meaning. it was like listening to a half-remembered voice. they had had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished like his parents at godric’s hollow ... or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it. ... sirius had bought him his first broomstick. . . . his parents had known bathilda bagshot had dumbledore introduced them dumbleclore’s still got his invisibility cloak ... there was something funny there. ... harry paused pondering his mother’s words. why had dumbledore taken james’s invisibility cloak harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before “i don’t need a cloak to become invisible.” perhaps some less gifted order member had needed its assistance and dumbledore had acted as carrier harry passed on. ... wormy was here . . . pettigrew the traitor had seemed “down,” had he was he aware that he was seeing james and lily alive for the last time and finally bathilda again who told incredible stories about dumbledore. it seems incredible that dumbledore — that dumbledore what but there were any number of things that would seem incredible about dumbledore that he had once received bottom marks in a transfiguration test for instance or had taken up goat-charming like aberforth. ... harry got to his feet and scanned the floor perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. he seized papers treating them in his eagerness with as little consideration as the original searcher he pulled open drawers shook out books stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe and crawled under the bed and armchair. at last lying facedown on the floor he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. when he pulled it out it proved to be most of the photograph lily had described in her letter. a black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom roaring with laughter and a pair of legs that must have belonged to james was chasing after him. harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with lily’s letter and continued to look for the second sheet. after another quarter of an hour however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone. had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room harry read the first sheet again this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. his toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the death eaters. ... the only potentially useful thing he could see here was possible information on dumbledore. it seems incredible that dumbledore — what “harry harry! harryv’ “i’m here!” he called. “what’s happened?” there was a clatter of footsteps outside the door and hermione burst inside. “we woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breathlessly. she turned and shouted over her shoulder “ron! i’ve found him!” ron’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below. “good! tell him from me he’s a git!” “harry don’t just disappear please we were terrified! why did you come up here anyway?” she gazed around the ransacked room. “what have you been doing?” “look what i’ve just found.” he held out his mother’s letter. hermione took it and read it while harry watched her. when she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. “oh harry ...” “and there’s this too.” he handed her the torn photograph and hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom. “i’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” harry said “but it’s not here.” hermione glanced around. “did you make all this mess or was some of it done when you got here?” “someone had searched before me,” said harry. “i thought so. every room i looked into on the way up had been disturbed. what were they after do you think?” “information on the order if it was snape.” “but you’d think he’d already have all he needed i mean he was in the order wasn’t he?” “well then,” said harry keen to discuss his theory “what about information on dumbledore the second page of this letter for instance. you know this bathilda my mum mentions you know who she is?” “who?” “bathilda bagshot the author of — ” “a history of magic,” said hermione looking interested. “so your parents knew her she was an incredible magical historian.” “and she’s still alive,” said harry “and she lives in godric’s hollow ron’s auntie muriel was talking about her at the wedding. she knew dumbledore ’s family too. be pretty interesting to talk to wouldn’t she?” there was a little too much understanding in the smile hermione gave him for harry’s liking. he took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck so as not to have to look at her and give himself away. “i understand why you’d love to talk to her about your mum and dad and dumbledore too,” said hermione. “but that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the horcruxes would it?” harry did not answer and she rushed on “harry i know you really want to go to godric’s hollow but i’m scared i’m scared at how easily those death eaters found us yesterday. it just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried i’m sure they’d be expecting you to visit it.” “it’s not just that,” harry said still avoiding looking at her. “muriel said stuff about dumbledore at the wedding. i want to know the truth. ...” he told hermione everything that muriel had told him. when he had finished hermione said “of course i can see why that’s upset you harry — ” “i’m not upset,” he lied “i’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or — ” “harry do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like muriel or from rita skeeter how can you believe them you knew dumbledore!” “i thought i did,” he muttered. “but you know how much truth there was in everything rita wrote about you! doge is right how can you let these people tarnish your memories of dumbledore?” he looked away trying not to betray the resentment he felt. there it was again choose what to believe. he wanted the truth. why was everybody so determined that he should not get it “shall we go down to the kitchen?” hermione suggested after a little pause. “find something for breakfast?” he agreed but grudgingly and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that led off it. there were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark. he paused at the top of the stairs to read it. it was a pompous little sign neatly lettered by hand the sort of thing that percy weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door do not enter without the express permission of regulus arcturus black excitement trickled through harry but he was not immediately sure why. he read the sign again. hermione was already a flight of stairs below him. “hermione,” he said and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. “come back up here.” “what’s the matter?” “r.a.b. i think i’ve found him.” there was a gasp and then hermione ran back up the stairs. “in your mum’s letter but i didn’t see — ” harry shook his head pointing at regulus’s sign. she read it then clutched harry’s arm so tightly that he winced. “sirius’s brother?” she whispered. “he was a death eater,” said harry “sirius told me about him he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed him.” “that fits!” gasped hermione. “if he was a death eater he had access to voldemort and if he became disenchanted then he would have wanted to bring voldemort down!” she released harry leaned over the banister and screamed “ron! ron! get up here quick!” ron appeared panting a minute later his wand ready in his hand. “what’s up if it’s massive spiders again i want breakfast before i — ” he frowned at the sign on regulus’s door to which hermione was silently pointing. “what that was sirius’s brother wasn’t it regulus arcturus ... regulus ... r.a.b.l the locket — you don’t reckon — ” “let’s find out,” said harry. he pushed the door it was locked. hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said “alohomora.” there was a click and the door swung open. they moved over the threshold together gazing around. regulus’s bedroom was slightly smaller than sirius’s though it had the same sense of former grandeur. whereas sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite. the slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere draping the bed the walls and the windows. the black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed along with its motto tou jours pur. beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings all stuck together to make a ragged collage. hermione crossed the room to examine them. “they’re all about voldemort,” she said. “regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the death eaters. ...” a little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. harry meanwhile had noticed another photograph a hogwarts quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. he moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests slytherins. regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row he had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother though he was smaller slighter and rather less handsome than sirius had been. “he played seeker,” said harry. “what?” said hermione vaguely she was still immersed in voldemort’s press clippings. “he’s sitting in the middle of the front row that’s where the seeker ... never mind,” said harry realizing that nobody was listening ron was on his hands and knees searching under the wardrobe. harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. yet again somebody had searched before them. the drawers’ contents had been turned over recently the dust disturbed but there was nothing of value there old quills out-of date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled a recently smashed ink bottle its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer. “there’s an easier way,” said hermione as harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. she raised her wand and said “accio locked.” nothing happened. ron who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains looked disappointed. “is that it then it’s not here?” “oh it could still be here but under counter enchantments,” said hermione. “charms to prevent it being summoned magically you know.” “like voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said harry remembering how he had been unable to summon the fake locket. “how are we supposed to find it then?” asked ron. “we search manually,” said hermione. “that’s a good idea,” said ron rolling his eyes and he resumed his examination of the curtains. they combed every inch of the room for more than an hour but were forced finally to conclude that the locket was not there. the sun had risen now its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows. “it could be somewhere else in the house though,” said hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs as harry and ron had become more discouraged she seemed to have become more determined. “whether he’d managed to destroy it or not he’d want to keep it hidden from voldemort wouldn’t he remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time that clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle ron regulus might have put them there to protect the locket’s hiding place even though we didn’t realize it at ... at ...” harry and ron looked at her. she was standing with one foot in midair with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been obliviated her eyes had even drifted out of focus. ... at the time,” she finished in a whisper. “something wrong?” asked ron. “there was a locket.” “what?” said harry and ron together. “in the cabinet in the drawing room. nobody could open it. and we ... we ...” harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. he remembered he had even handled the thing as they passed it around each trying in turn to prise it open. it had been tossed into a sack of rubbish along with the snuffbox of wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy. ... “kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said harry. it was the only chance the only slender hope left to them and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. “he had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. c’mon.” he ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time the other two thundering along in his wake. they made so much noise that they woke the portrait of sirius’s mother as they passed through the hall. “filth). mudbloods scum)” she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them. harry ran the length of the room skidded to a halt at the door of kreacher’s cupboard and wrenched it open. there was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept but they were no longer glittering with the trinkets kreacher had salvaged. the only thing there was an old copy of nature’s nobility a wizarding genealogy. refusing to believe his eyes harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. a dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor. ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair hermione closed her eyes. “it’s not over yet,” said harry and he raised his voice and called “ kreacherl” there was a loud crack and the house-elf that harry had so reluctantly inherited from sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace tiny half human-sized his pale skin hanging off him in folds white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. he was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him and the contemptuous look he bent upon harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit. “master,” croaked kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice and he bowed low muttering to his knees “back in my mistress’s old house with the blood-traitor weasley and the mudblood — ” “i forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor’ or ‘mudblood,’ ” growled harry. he would have found kreacher with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed sirius to voldemort. “i’ve got a question for you,” said harry his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf “and i order you to answer it truthfully. understand?” “yes master,” said kreacher bowing low again harry saw his lips moving soundlessly undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. “two years ago,” said harry his heart now hammering against his ribs “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. we threw it out. did you steal it back?” there was a moment’s silence during which kreacher straightened up to look harry full in the face. then he said “yes.” “where is it now?” asked harry jubilantly as ron and hermione looked gleeful. kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word. “gone.” “gone?” echoed harry elation flooding out of him. “what do you mean it’s gone?” the elf shivered. he swayed. “kreacher,” said harry fiercely “i order you — ” “mundungus fletcher,” croaked the elf his eyes still tight shut. “mundungus fletcher stole it all miss bella’s and miss cissy’s pictures my mistress’s gloves the order of merlin first class the goblets with the family crest and — and — ” kreacher was gulping for air his hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream. “ — and the locket master regulus’s locket kreacher did wrong kreacher failed in his orders!” harry reacted instinctively as kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate he launched himself upon the elf flattening him. hermione’s scream mingled with kreacher’s but harry bellowed louder than both of them “kreacher i order you to stay still!” he felt the elf freeze and released him. kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor tears gushing from his sagging eyes. “harry let him up!” hermione whispered. “so he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted harry kneeling beside the elf. “i don’t think so. right kreacher i want the truth how do you know mundungus fletcher stole the locket?” “kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth. “kreacher saw him coming out of kreacher’s cupboard with his hands full of kreacher’s treasures. kreacher told the sneak thief to stop but mundungus fletcher laughed and r-ran. ...” “you called the locket ‘master regulus ’s,’ ” said harry. “why where did it come from what did regulus have to do with it kreacher sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket and everything regulus had to do with it!” the elf sat up curled into a ball placed his wet face between his knees and began to rock backward and forward. when he spoke his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent echoing kitchen. “master sirius ran away good riddance for he was a bad boy and broke my mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. but master regulus had proper pride he knew what was due to the name of black and the dignity of his pure blood. for years he talked of the dark lord who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the muggles and the muggle-borns . . . and when he was sixteen years old master regulus joined the dark lord. so proud so proud so happy to serve ... “and one day a year after he had joined master regulus came down to the kitchen to see kreacher. master regulus always liked kreacher. and master regulus said ... he said ...” the old elf rocked faster than ever. ... he said that the dark lord required an elf.” “voldemort needed an elf?” harry repeated looking around at ron and hermione who looked just as puzzled as he did. “oh yes,” moaned kreacher. “and master regulus had volunteered kreacher. it was an honor said master regulus an honor for him and for kreacher who must be sure to do whatever the dark lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home.” kreacher rocked still faster his breath coming in sobs. “so kreacher went to the dark lord. the dark lord did not tell kreacher what they were to do but took kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. and beyond the cave there was a cavern and in the cavern was a great black lake ...” the hairs on the back of harry’s neck stood up. kreacher’s croaking voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. he saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present. ... there was a boat ...” of course there had been a boat harry knew the boat ghostly green and tiny bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. this then was how voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the horcrux by borrowing a disposable creature a house-elf ... “there was a b-basin full of potion on the island. the d-dark lord made kreacher drink it. ...” the elf quaked from head to foot. “kreacher drank and as he drank he saw terrible things. ... kreacher’s insides burned. ... kreacher cried for master regulus to save him he cried for his mistress black but the dark lord only laughed. ... he made kreacher drink all the potion. ... he dropped a locket into the empty basin. ... he filled it with more potion. “and then the dark lord sailed away leaving kreacher on the island. ...” harry could see it happening. he watched voldemort’s white snakelike face vanishing into darkness those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning potion caused its victim. ... but here harry’s imagination could go no further for he could not see how kreacher had escaped. “kreacher needed water he crawled to the island’s edge and he drank from the black lake ... and hands dead hands came out of the water and dragged kreacher under the surface. ...” “how did you get away?” harry asked and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering. kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at harry with his great bloodshot eyes. “master regulus told kreacher to come back,” he said. “i know — but how did you escape the inferi?” kreacher did not seem to understand. “master regulus told kreacher to come back,” he repeated. “i know but — ” “well it’s obvious isn’t it harry?” said ron. “he disapparated!” “but ... you couldn’t apparate in and out of that cave,” said harry “otherwise dumbledore — ” “elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic is it?” said ron. “i mean they can apparate and disapparate in and out of hogwarts when we can’t.” there was silence as harry digested this. how could voldemort have made such a mistake but even as he thought this hermione spoke and her voice was icy. “of course voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals. ... it would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn’t.” “the house-elf’s highest law is his master’s bidding,” intoned kreacher. “kreacher was told to come home so kreacher came home. ...” “well then you did what you were told didn’t you?” said hermione kindly. “you didn’t disobey orders at all!” kreacher shook his head rocking as fast as ever. “so what happened when you got back?” harry asked. “what did regulus say when you told him what had happened?” “master regulus was very worried very worried,” croaked kreacher. “master regulus told kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. and then ... it was a little while later . . . master regulus came to find kreacher in his cupboard one night and master regulus was strange not as he usually was disturbed in his mind kreacher could tell . . . and he asked kreacher to take him to the cave the cave where kreacher had gone with the dark lord. ...” and so they had set off. harry could visualize them quite clearly the frightened old elf and the thin dark seeker who had so resembled sirius. ... kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern knew how to raise the tiny boat this time it was his beloved regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison. ... “and he made you drink the potion?” said harry disgusted. but kreacher shook his head and wept. hermione’s hands leapt to her mouth she seemed to have understood something. “m-master regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the dark lord had,” said kreacher tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. “and he told kreacher to take it and when the basin was empty to switch the lockets. ...” kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now harry had to concentrate hard to understand him. “and he ordered — kreacher to leave — without him. and he told kreacher — to go home — and never to tell my mistress — what he had done — but to destroy — the first locket. and he drank — all the potion — and kreacher swapped the lockets — and watched ... as master regulus . . . was dragged beneath the water ... and ...” “oh kreacher!” wailed hermione who was crying. she dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. at once he was on his feet cringing away from her quite obviously repulsed. “the mudblood touched kreacher he will not allow it what would his mistress say?” “i told you not to call her ‘mudblood’!” snarled harry but the elf was already punishing himself he fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor. “stop him — stop him!” hermione cried. “oh don’t you see now how sick it is the way they’ve got to obey?” “kreacher — stop stop!” shouted harry. the elf lay on the floor panting and shivering green mucus glistening around his snout a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. harry had never seen anything so pitiful. “so you brought the locket home,” he said relentlessly for he was determined to know the full story. “and you tried to destroy it?” “nothing kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the elf. “kreacher tried everything everything he knew but nothing nothing would work. ... so many powerful spells upon the casing kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it but it would not open. . . . kreacher punished himself he tried again he punished himself he tried again. kreacher failed to obey orders kreacher could not destroy the locket! and his mistress was mad with grief because master regulus had disappeared and kreacher could not tell her what had happened no because master regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave. ...” kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. tears flowed down hermione’s cheeks as she watched kreacher but she did not dare touch him again. even ron who was no fan of kreacher’s looked troubled. harry sat back on his heels and shook his head trying to clear it. “i don’t understand you kreacher,” he said finally. “voldemort tried to kill you regulus died to bring voldemort down but you were still happy to betray sirius to voldemort you were happy to go to narcissa and bellatrix and pass information to voldemort through them. ...” “harry kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said hermione wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. “he’s a slave house-elves are used to bad even brutal treatment what voldemort did to kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way. what do wizard wars mean to an elf like kreacher he’s loyal to people who are kind to him and mrs. black must have been and regulus certainly was so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. i know what you’re going to say,” she went on as harry began to protest “that regulus changed his mind . . . but he doesn’t seem to have explained that to kreacher does he and i think i know why. kreacher and regulus ’s family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. regulus was trying to protect them all.” “sirius — ” “sirius was horrible to kreacher harry and it’s no good looking like that you know it’s true. kreacher had been alone for a long time when sirius came to live here and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. i’m sure ‘miss cissy’ and ‘miss bella’ were perfectly lovely to kreacher when he turned up so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know. i’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. well voldemort did ... and so did sirius.” harry had no retort. as he watched kreacher sobbing on the floor he remembered what dumbledore had said to him mere hours after sirius’s death i do not think sirius ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s. ... “kreacher,” said harry after a while “when you feel up to it er ... please sit up.” it was several minutes before kreacher hiccuped himself into silence. then he pushed himself into a sitting position again rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child. “kreacher i am going to ask you to do something,” said harry. he glanced at hermione for assistance. he wanted to give the order kindly but at the same time he could not pretend that it was not an order. however the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval she smiled encouragingly. “kreacher i want you please to go and find mundungus fletcher. we need to find out where the locket — where master regulus’s locket is. it’s really important. we want to finish the work master regulus started we want to — er — ensure that he didn’t die in vain.” kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at harry. “find mundungus fletcher?” he croaked. “and bring him here to grimmauld place,” said harry. “do you think you could do that for us?” as kreacher nodded and got to his feet harry had a sudden inspiration. he pulled out hagrid’s purse and took out the fake horcrux the substitute locket in which regulus had placed the note to voldemort. “kreacher i’d er like you to have this,” he said pressing the locket into the elf’s hand. “this belonged to regulus and i’m sure he’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you — ” “overkill mate,” said ron as the elf took one look at the locket let out a howl of shock and misery and threw himself back onto the ground. it took them nearly half an hour to calm down kreacher who was so overcome to be presented with a black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. when finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away. he then made two low bows to harry and ron and even gave a funny little spasm in hermione’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute before disapparating with the usual loud crack. the bribe if kreacher could escape a lake full of inferi harry was confident that the capture of mundungus would take a few hours at most and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. however kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. by nightfall harry felt discouraged and anxious and a supper composed largely of moldy bread upon which hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful transfigurations did nothing to help. kreacher did not return the following day nor the day after that. however two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve and they remained there into the night gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see. “death eaters for sure,” said ron as he harry and hermione watched from the drawing room windows. “reckon they know we’re in here?” “i don’t think so,” said hermione though she looked frightened “or they’d have sent snape in after us wouldn’t they?” “d’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue tied by moody’s curse?” asked ron. “yes,” said hermione “otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in wouldn’t he but they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up. they know that harry owns the house after all.” “how do they — ” began harry. “wizarding wills are examined by the ministry remember they’ll know sirius left you the place.” the presence of the death eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. they had not heard a word from anyone beyond grimmauld place since mr. weasley’s patronus and the strain was starting to tell. restless and irritable ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the deluminator in his pocket this particularly infuriated hermione who was whiling away the wait for kreacher by studying the tales of beedle the bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. “will you stop it!” she cried on the third evening of kreacher’s absence as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again. “sorry sorry!” said ron clicking the deluminator and restoring the lights. “i don’t know i’m doing it!” “well can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?” “what like reading kids’ stories?” “dumbledore left me this book ron — ” “ — and he left me the deluminator maybe i’m supposed to use it!” unable to stand the bickering harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. he headed downstairs toward the kitchen which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where kreacher was most likely to reappear. halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall however he heard a tap on the front door then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. every nerve in his body seemed to tauten he pulled out his wand moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads and waited. the door opened he saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. the intruder took a step forward and moody’s voice asked “severus snape ” then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him raising its dead hand. “it was not i who killed you albus,” said a quiet voice. the jinx broke the dust-figure exploded again and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. harry pointed his wand into the middle of it. “don’t move!” he had forgotten the portrait of mrs. black at the sound of his yell the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream “mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house — ” ron and hermione came crashing down the stairs behind harry wands pointing like his at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. “hold your fire it’s me remus!” “oh thank goodness,” said hermione weakly pointing her wand at mrs. black instead with a bang the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. ron too lowered his wand but harry did not. “show yourself!” he called back. lupin moved forward into the lamplight hands still held high in a gesture of surrender. “i am remus john lupin werewolf sometimes known as moony one of the four creators of the marauder’s map married to nymphadora usually known as tonks and i taught you how to produce a patronus harry which takes the form of a stag.” “oh all right,” said harry lowering his wand “but i had to check didn’t i?” “speaking as your ex-defense against the dark arts teacher i quite agree that you had to check. ron hermione you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower your defenses.” they ran down the stairs toward him. wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak he looked exhausted but pleased to see them. “no sign of severus then?” he asked. “no,” said harry. “what’s going on is everyone okay?” “yes,” said lupin “but we’re all being watched. there are a couple of death eaters in the square outside — ” “we know — ” “i had to apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. they can’t know you’re in here or i’m sure they’d have more people out there they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you harry. let’s go downstairs there’s a lot to tell you and i want to know what happened after you left the burrow.” they descended into the kitchen where hermione pointed her wand at the grate. a fire sprang up instantly it gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down. “i’d have been here three days ago but i needed to shake off the death eater tailing me,” said lupin. “so you came straight here after the wedding?” “no,” said harry “only after we ran into a couple of death eaters in a cafe on tottenham court road.” lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. “ what ” they explained what had happened when they had finished lupin looked aghast. “but how did they find you so quickly it’s impossible to track anyone who apparates unless you grab hold of them as they disappear!” “and it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down tottenham court road at the time does it?” said harry. “we wondered,” said hermione tentatively “whether harry could still have the trace on him?” “impossible,” said lupin. ron looked smug and harry felt hugely relieved. “apart from anything else they’d know for sure harry was here if he still had the trace on him wouldn’t they but i can’t see how they could have tracked you to tottenham court road that’s worrying really worrying.” he looked disturbed but as far as harry was concerned that question could wait. “tell us what happened after we left we haven’t heard a thing since ron’s dad told us the family were safe.” “well kingsley saved us,” said lupin. “thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to disapparate before they arrived.” “were they death eaters or ministry people?” interjected hermione. “a mixture but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,” said lupin. “there were about a dozen of them but they didn’t know you were there harry. arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of scrimgeour before they killed him if it’s true he didn’t give you away.” harry looked at ron and hermione their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. he had never liked scrimgeour much but if what lupin said was true the man’s final act had been to try to protect harry. “the death eaters searched the burrow from top to bottom,” lupin went on. “they found the ghoul but didn’t want to get too close — and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. they were trying to get information on you harry but of course nobody apart from the order knew that you had been there. “at the same time that they were smashing up the wedding more death eaters were forcing their way into every order-connected house in the country. no deaths,” he added quickly forestalling the question “but they were rough. they burned down dedalus diggle’s house but as you know he wasn’t there and they used the cruciatus curse on tonks’s family. again trying to find out where you went after you visited them. they’re all right — shaken obviously but otherwise okay.” “the death eaters got through all those protective charms?” harry asked remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in tonks’s parents’ garden. “what you’ve got to realize harry is that the death eaters have got the full might of the ministry on their side now,” said lupin. “they’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. they managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them and once inside they were completely open about why they’d come.” “and are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing harry’s whereabouts out of people?” asked hermione an edge to her voice. “well,” said lupin. he hesitated then pulled out a folded copy of the daily prophet “here,” he said pushing it across the table to harry “you’ll know sooner or later anyway. that’s their pretext for going after you.” harry smoothed out the paper. a huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. he read the headline over it wanted for questioning about the death of albus dumbledore ron and hermione gave roars of outrage but harry said nothing. he pushed the newspaper away he did not want to read any more he knew what it would say. nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and as rita skeeter had already told the wizarding world harry had been seen running from the place moments after dumbledore had fallen. “i’m sorry harry,” lupin said. “so death eaters have taken over the daily prophet too?” asked hermione furiously. lupin nodded. “but surely people realize what’s going on?” “the coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said lupin. “the official version of scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned he has been replaced by pius thicknesse who is under the imperius curse.” “why didn’t voldemort declare himself minister of magic?” asked ron. lupin laughed. “he doesn’t need to ron. effectively he is the minister but why should he sit behind a desk at the ministry his puppet thicknesse is taking care of everyday business leaving voldemort free to extend his power beyond the ministry. “naturally many people have deduced what has happened there has been such a dramatic change in ministry policy in the last few days and many are whispering that voldemort must be behind it. however that is the point they whisper. they daren’t confide in each other not knowing whom to trust they are scared to speak out in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. yes voldemort is playing a very clever game. declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion remaining masked has created confusion uncertainty and fear.” “and this dramatic change in ministry policy,” said harry “involves warning the wizarding world against me instead of voldemort?” “that’s certainly part of it,” said lupin “and it is a masterstroke. now that dumbledore is dead you — the boy who lived — were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to voldemort. but by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero’s death voldemort has not only set a price upon your head but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you. “meanwhile the ministry has started moving against muggle-borns.” lupin pointed at the daily prophet “look at page two.” hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had worn when handling secrets of the darkest art “ ‘muggle-born register,’ ” she read aloud. “ ‘the ministry of magic is undertaking a survey of so-called “muggle-borns,” the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. “ ‘recent research undertaken by the department of mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when wizards reproduce. where no proven wizarding ancestry exists therefore the so called muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force. “ ‘the ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed muggle-born registration commission.’ ” “people won’t let this happen,” said ron. “it is happening ron,” said lupin. “muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.” “but how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?” said ron. “it’s mental if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any squibs would there?” “i know,” said lupin. “nevertheless unless you can prove that you have at least one close wizarding relative you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.” ron glanced at hermione then said “what if purebloods and half-bloods swear a muggle-born’s part of their family i’ll tell everyone hermione ’s my cousin — ” hermione covered ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it. “thank you ron but i couldn’t let you — ” “you won’t have a choice,” said ron fiercely gripping her hand back. “i’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it. hermione gave a shaky laugh. “ron as we’re on the run with harry potter the most wanted person in the country i don’t think it matters. if i was going back to school it would be different. what’s voldemort planning for hogwarts?” she asked lupin. “attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” he replied. “that was announced yesterday. it’s a change because it was never obligatory before. of course nearly every witch and wizard in britain has been educated at hogwarts but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. this way voldemort will have the whole wizarding population under his eye from a young age. and it’s also another way of weeding out muggle-borns because students must be given blood status — meaning that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard descent — before they are allowed to attend.” harry felt sickened and angry at this moment excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-books unaware that they would never see hogwarts perhaps never see their families again either. “it’s ... it’s ...” he muttered struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts but lupin said quietly “i know.” lupin hesitated. “i’ll understand if you can’t confirm this harry but the order is under the impression that dumbledore left you a mission.” “he did,” harry replied “and ron and hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.” “can you confide in me what the mission is?” harry looked into the prematurely lined face framed in thick but graying hair and wished that he could return a different answer. “i can’t remus i’m sorry. if dumbledore didn’t tell you i don’t think i can.” “i thought you’d say that,” said lupin looking disappointed. “but i might still be of some use to you. you know what i am and what i can do. i could come with you to provide protection. there would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.” harry hesitated. it was a very tempting offer though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. hermione however looked puzzled. “but what about tonks?” she asked. “what about her?” said lupin. “well,” said hermione frowning “you’re married! how does she feel about you going away with us?” “tonks will be perfectly safe,” said lupin. “she’ll be at her parents’ house.” there was something strange in lupin’s tone it was almost cold. there was also something odd in the idea of tonks remaining hidden at her parents’ house she was after all a member of the order and as far as harry knew was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. “remus,” said hermione tentatively “is everything all right . . . you know . . . between you and — ” “everything is fine thank you,” said lupin pointedly. hermione turned pink. there was another pause an awkward and embarrassed one and then lupin said with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant “tonks is going to have a baby.” “oh how wonderful!” squealed hermione. “excellent!” said ron enthusiastically. “congratulations,” said harry. lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace then said “so ... do you accept my offer will three become four i cannot believe that dumbledore would have disapproved he appointed me your defense against the dark arts teacher after all. and i must tell you that i believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.” ron and hermione both looked at harry. “just — just to be clear,” he said. “you want to leave tonks at her parents’ house and come away with us?” “she’ll be perfectly safe there they’ll look after her,” said lupin. he spoke with a finality bordering on indifference. “harry i’m sure james would have wanted me to stick with you.” “well,” said harry slowly “i’m not. i’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid actually.” lupin’s face drained of color. the temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it while hermione ’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from harry to lupin. “you don’t understand,” said lupin at last. “explain then,” said harry. lupin swallowed. “i — i made a grave mistake in marrying tonks. i did it against my better judgment and i have regretted it very much ever since.” “i see,” said harry “so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?” lupin sprang to his feet his chair toppled over backward and he glared at them so fiercely that harry saw for the first time ever the shadow of the wolf upon his human face. “don’t you understand what i’ve done to my wife and my unborn child i should never have married her i’ve made her an outcast!” lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. “you have only ever seen me amongst the order or under dumbledore’s protection at hogwarts! you don’t know how most of the wizarding world sees creatures like me! when they know of my affliction they can barely talk to me! don’t you see what i’ve done even her own family is disgusted by our marriage what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf and the child — the child — ” lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair he looked quite deranged. “my kind don’t usually breed! it will be like me i am convinced of it — how can i forgive myself when i knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child and if by some miracle it is not like me then it will be better off a hundred times so without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!” “remus!” whispered hermione tears in her eyes. “don’t say that — how could any child be ashamed of you?” “oh i don’t know hermione,” said harry. “i’d be pretty ashamed of him.” harry did not know where his rage was coming from but it had propelled him to his feet too. lupin looked as though harry had hit him. “if the new regime thinks muggle-borns are bad,” harry said “what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the order my father died trying to protect my mother and me and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?” “how — how dare you?” said lupin. “this is not about a desire for — for danger or personal glory — how dare you suggest such a — ” “i think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil,” harry said. “you fancy stepping into sirius’s shoes — ” “harry no!” hermione begged him but he continued to glare into lupin’s livid face. “i’d never have believed this,” harry said. “the man who taught me to fight dementors — a coward.” lupin drew his wand so fast that harry had barely reached for his own there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor he glimpsed the tail of lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door. “remus remus come back!” hermione cried but lupin did not respond. a moment later they heard the front door slam. “harry!” wailed hermione. “how could you?” “it was easy,” said harry. he stood up he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. he was still so full of anger he was shaking. “don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at hermione. “don’t you start on her!” snarled ron. “no — no — we mustn’t fight!” said hermione launching herself between them. “you shouldn’t have said that stuff to lupin,” ron told harry. “he had it coming to him,” said harry. broken images were racing each other through his mind sirius falling through the veil dumbledore suspended broken in midair a flash of green light and his mother’s voice begging for mercy ... “parents,” said harry “shouldn’t leave their kids unless — unless they’ve got to.” “harry — ” said hermione stretching out a consoling hand but he shrugged it off and walked away his eyes on the fire hermione had conjured. he had once spoken to lupin out of that fireplace seeking reassurance about james and lupin had consoled him. now lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. he felt a sickening surge of remorse. neither ron nor hermione spoke but harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back communicating silently. he turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other. “i know i shouldn’t have called him a coward.” “no you shouldn’t,” said ron at once. “but he’s acting like one.” “all the same ...” said hermione. “i know,” said harry. “but if it makes him go back to tonks it’ll be worth it won’t it?” he could not keep the plea out of his voice. hermione looked sympathetic ron uncertain. harry looked down at his feet thinking of his father. would james have backed harry in what he had said to lupin or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend the silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with ron and hermione ’s unspoken reproaches. the daily prophet lupin had brought was still lying on the table harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. he walked over to it and sat down opened the paper at random and pretended to read. he could not take in the words his mind was still too full of the encounter with lupin. he was sure that ron and hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the prophet he turned a page loudly and dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. it was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph which showed a family group. beneath the photograph were the words the dumbledore family left to right albus percival holding newborn ariana kendra and aberforth. his attention caught harry examined the picture more carefully. dumbledore’s father percival was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. the baby ariana was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. the mother kendra had jet-black hair pulled into a high bun. her face had a carved quality about it. harry thought of photos of native americans he’d seen as he studied her dark eyes high cheekbones and straight nose formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. albus and aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical shoulder-length hairstyles. albus looked several years older but otherwise the two boys looked very alike for this was before albus ’s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses. the family looked quite happy and normal smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. baby ariana’s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. harry looked above the picture and saw the headline exclusive extract from the upcoming biography of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did harry began to read proud and haughty kendra dumbledore could not bear to remain in mould-on-the-wold after her husband percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in azkaban. she therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to godric’s hollow the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of harry potter’s strange escape from you-know-who. like mould-on-the-wold godric’s hollow was home to a number of wizarding families but as kendra knew none of them she would be spared the curiosity about her husband’s crime she had faced in her former village. by repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new wizarding neighbors she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. “slammed the door in my face when i went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade cauldron cakes,” says bathilda bagshot. “the first year they were there i only ever saw the two boys. wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if i hadn’t been picking plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in and saw kendra leading ariana out into the back garden. walked her round the lawn once keeping a firm grip on her then took her back inside. didn’t know what to make of it. ” it seems that kendra thought the move to godric’s hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide ariana once and for all something she had probably been planning for years. the timing was significant. ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself if present. nobody now alive remembers ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. it seems clear therefore that kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a squib. moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew ariana would of course make imprisoning her all the easier. the tiny number of people who henceforth knew of ariana’s existence could be counted upon to keep the secret including her two brothers who deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them “my sister is too frail for school.” next week albus dumbledore at hogwarts — the prizes and the pretense. harry had been wrong what he had read had indeed made him feel worse. he looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. was it true how could he find out he wanted to go to godric’s hollow even if bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him he wanted to visit the place where he and dumbledore had both lost loved ones. he was in the process of lowering the newspaper to ask ron’s and hermione’s opinions when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. for the first time in three days harry had forgotten all about kreacher. his immediate thought was that lupin had burst back into the room and for a split second he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. he hurried to his feet as kreacher disentangled himself and bowing low to harry croaked “kreacher has returned with the thief mundungus fletcher master.” mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand hermione however was too quick for him. “expelliarmusl” mundungus ’s wand soared into the air and hermione caught it. wild-eyed mundungus dived for the stairs ron rugby-tackled him and mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch. “what?” he bellowed writhing in his attempts to free himself from ron’s grip. “wha’ve i done setting a bleedin’ ’ouse-elf on me what are you playing at wha’ve i done lemme go lemme go or — ” “you’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said harry. he threw aside the newspaper crossed the kitchen in a few strides and dropped to his knees beside mundungus who stopped struggling and looked terrified. ron got up panting and watched as harry pointed his wand deliberately at mundungus ’s nose. mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke his hair was matted and his robes stained. “kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief master,” croaked the elf. “fletcher knows how to avoid capture has many hidey-holes and accomplices. nevertheless kreacher cornered the thief in the end.” “you’ve done really well kreacher,” said harry and the elf bowed low. “right we’ve got a few questions for you,” harry told mundungus who shouted at once “i panicked okay i never wanted to come along no offense mate but i never volunteered to die for you an’ that was bleedin’ you-know-who come flying at me anyone woulda got outta there i said all along i didn’t wanna do it — ” “for your information none of the rest of us disapparated,” said hermione. “well you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ’eroes then aren’t you but i never pretended i was up for killing meself “we’re not interested in why you ran out on mad eye,” said harry moving his wand a little closer to mundungus’s baggy bloodshot eyes. “we already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.” “well then why the ’ell am i being ’unted down by ’ouse-elves or is this about them goblets again i ain’t got none of ’em left or you could ’ave ’em — ” “it’s not about the goblets either although you’re getting warmer,” said harry. “shut up and listen.” it felt wonderful to have something to do someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth. harry’s wand was now so close to the bridge of mundungus’s nose that mundungus had gone cross eyed trying to keep it in view. “when you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” harry began but mundungus interrupted him again. “sirius never cared about any of the junk — ” there was the sound of pattering feet a blaze of shining copper an echoing clang and a shriek of agony kreacher had taken a run at mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan. “call ’im off call ’im off ’e should be locked up!” screamed mundungus cowering as kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. “kreacher no!” shouted harry. kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan still held aloft. “perhaps just one more master harry for luck?” ron laughed. “we need him conscious kreacher but if he needs persuading you can do the honors,” said harry. “thank you very much master,” said kreacher with a bow and he retreated a short distance his great pale eyes still fixed upon mundungus with loathing. “when you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,” harry began again “you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. there was a locket there.” harry’s mouth was suddenly dry he could sense ron and hermione’s tension and excitement too. “what did you do with it?” “why?” asked mundungus. “is it valuable?” “you’ve still got it!” cried hermione. “no he hasn’t,” said ron shrewdly. “he’s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it.” “more?” said mundungus. “that wouldn’t have been effing difficult ... bleedin’ gave it away di’n’ i no choice.” “what do you mean?” “i was selling in diagon alley and she come up to me and asks if i’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. bleedin’ snoop. she was gonna fine me but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it and let me off that time and to fink meself lucky.” “who was this woman?” asked harry. “i dunno some ministry hag.” mundungus considered for a moment brow wrinkled. “little woman. bow on top of ’er head.” he frowned and then added “looked like a toad.” harry dropped his wand it hit mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows which ignited. “aguamenti\” screamed hermione and a jet of water streamed from her wand engulfing a spluttering and choking mundungus. harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in ron’s and hermione’s faces. the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. magic is might as august wore on the square of unkempt grass in the middle of grimmauld place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. the inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses and nor was number twelve itself. the muggles who lived in grimmauld place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen. and yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in grimmauld place with no other purpose or so it seemed than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen watching the join between the two houses. the lurkers were never the same two days running although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. most of the londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice though occasionally one of them might glance back wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat. the watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. occasionally one of them started forward excitedly as if they had seen something interesting at last only to fall back looking disappointed. on the first day of september there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. as evening drew in bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. the man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion a podgy pallid man started forward but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity looking frustrated and disappointed. meanwhile inside number twelve harry had just entered the hall. he had nearly lost his balance as he apparated onto the top step just outside the front door and thought that the death eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. shutting the front door carefully behind him he pulled off the invisibility cloak draped it over his arm and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement a stolen copy of the daily prophet clutched in his hand. the usual low whisper of “severus snape?” greeted him the chill wind swept him and his tongue rolled up for a moment. “i didn’t kill you,” he said once it had unrolled then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. he waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen out of earshot of mrs. black and clear of the dust cloud before calling “i’ve got news and you won’t like it.” the kitchen was almost unrecognizable. every surface now shone copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow the wooden tabletop gleamed the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire on which a cauldron was simmering. nothing in the room however was more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward harry dressed in a snowy-white towel his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool regulus’s locket bouncing on his thin chest. “shoes off if you please master harry and hands washed before dinner,” croaked kreacher seizing the invisibility cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. “what’s happened?” ron asked apprehensively. he and hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table but now they watched harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment. a large picture of a familiar hook-nosed black-haired man stared up at them all beneath a headline that read severus snape confirmed as hogwarts headmaster “no!” said ron and hermione loudly. hermione was quickest she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud. “ ‘severus snape long-standing potions master at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. following the resignation of the previous muggle studies teacher alecto carrow will take over the post while her brother amycus fills the position of defense against the dark arts professor. “ 7 welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest wizarding traditions and values — ’ like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears i suppose! snape headmaster! snape in dumbledore’s study — merlin’s pants!” she shrieked making both harry and ron jump. she leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room shouting as she went “i’ll be back in a minute!” “ ‘merlin’s pants?” repeated ron looking amused. “she must be upset.” he pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about snape. “the other teachers won’t stand for this. mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout all know the truth they know how dumbledore died. they won’t accept snape as headmaster. and who are these carrows?” “death eaters,” said harry. “there are pictures of them inside. they were at the top of the tower when snape killed dumbledore so it’s all friends together. and,” harry went on bitterly drawing up a chair “i can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. if the ministry and voldemort are behind snape it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching or a nice few years in azkaban — and that’s if they’re lucky. i reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the students.” kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands and ladled out soup into pristine bowls whistling between his teeth as he did so. “thanks kreacher,” said harry flipping over the prophet so as not to have to look at snape ’s face. “well at least we know exactly where snape is now.” he began to spoon soup into his mouth. the quality of kreacher’s cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given regulus’s locket today’s french onion was as good as harry had ever tasted. “there are still a load of death eaters watching the house,” he told ron as he ate “more than usual. it’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the hogwarts express.” ron glanced at his watch. “i’ve been thinking about that all day. it left nearly six hours ago. weird not being on it isn’t it?” in his mind’s eye harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and ron had once followed it by air shimmering between fields and hills a rippling scarlet caterpillar. he was sure ginny neville and luna were sitting together at this moment perhaps wondering where he ron and hermione were or debating how best to undermine snape ’s new regime. “they nearly saw me coming back in just now,” harry said. “i landed badly on the top step and the cloak slipped.” “i do that every time. oh here she is,” ron added craning around in his seat to watch hermione reentering the kitchen. “and what in the name of merlin’s most baggy y fronts was that about?” “i remembered this,” hermione panted. she was carrying a large framed picture which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. opening it she proceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag within a few seconds it had vanished like so much else into the bag’s capacious depths. “phineas nigellus,” hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous clanking crash. “sorry?” said ron but harry understood. the painted image of phineas nigellus black was able to flit between his portrait in grimmauld place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at hogwarts the circular tower-top room where snape was no doubt sitting right now in triumphant possession of dumbledore’s collection of delicate silver magical instruments the stone pensieve the sorting hat and unless it had been moved elsewhere the sword of gryffindor. “snape could send phineas nigellus to look inside this house for him,” hermione explained to ron as she resumed her seat. “but let him try it now all phineas nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.” “good thinking!” said ron looking impressed. “thank you,” smiled hermione pulling her soup toward her. “so harry what else happened today?” “nothing,” said harry. “watched the ministry entrance for seven hours. no sign of her. saw your dad though ron. he looks fine.” ron nodded his appreciation of this news. they had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with mr. weasley while he walked in and out of the ministry because he was always surrounded by other ministry workers. it was however reassuring to catch these glimpses of him even if he did look very strained and anxious. “dad always told us most ministry people use the floo network to get to work,” ron said. “that’s why we haven’t seen umbridge she’d never walk she’d think she’s too important.” “and what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” hermione asked. “oh yeah the bloke from magical maintenance,” said ron. “how do you know he works for magical maintenance?” hermione asked her soupspoon suspended in midair. “dad said everyone from magical maintenance wears navy blue robes.” “but you never told us that!” hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and ron had been examining when harry had entered the kitchen. “there’s nothing in here about navy blue robes nothing!” she said flipping feverishly through the pages. “well does it really matter?” “ron it all matters! if we’re going to get into the ministry and not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders every little detail matters! we’ve been over and over this i mean what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell us — ” “blimey hermione i forget one little thing — ” “you do realize don’t you that there’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the ministry of — ” “i think we should do it tomorrow,” said harry. hermione stopped dead her jaw hanging ron choked a little over his soup. “tomorrow?” repeated hermione. “you aren’t serious harry?” “i am,” said harry. “i don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the ministry entrance for another month. the longer we put it off the farther away that locket could be. there’s already a good chance umbridge has chucked it away the thing doesn’t open.” “unless,” said ron “she’s found a way of opening it and she’s now possessed.” “wouldn’t make any difference to her she was so evil in the first place,” harry shrugged. hermione was biting her lip deep in thought. “we know everything important,” harry went on addressing hermione. “we know they’ve stopped apparition in and out of the ministry. we know only the most senior ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the floo network now because ron heard those two unspeakables complaining about it. and we know roughly where umbridge’s office is because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate — ” “ ‘i’ll be up on level one dolores wants to see me,’ ” hermione recited immediately. “exactly,” said harry. “and we know you get in using those funny coins or tokens or whatever they are because i saw that witch borrowing one from her friend — ” “but we haven’t got any!” “if the plan works we will have,” harry continued calmly. “i don’t know harry i don’t know. ... there are an awful lot of things that could go wrong so much relies on chance. ...” “that’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,” said harry. “it’s time to act.” he could tell from ron’s and hermione’s faces that they were scared he was not particularly confident himself and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation. they had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the invisibility cloak and spy on the official entrance to the ministry which ron thanks to mr. weasley had known since childhood. they had tailed ministry workers on their way in eavesdropped on their conversations and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear alone at the same time every day. occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a daily prophet out of somebody’s briefcase. slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of hermione. “all right,” said ron slowly “let’s say we go for it tomorrow. ... i think it should just be me and harry.” “oh don’t start that again!” sighed hermione. “i thought we’d settled this.” “it’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the cloak but this is different hermione.” ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the daily prophet dated ten days previously. “you’re on the list of muggle borns who didn’t present themselves for interrogation!” “and you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the burrow! if anyone shouldn’t go it’s harry he’s got a ten-thousand-galleon price on his head — ” “fine i’ll stay here,” said harry. “let me know if you ever defeat voldemort won’t you?” as ron and hermione laughed pain shot through the scar on harry’s forehead. his hand jumped to it he saw hermione’s eyes narrow and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes. “well if all three of us go well have to disapparate separately,” ron was saying. “we can’t all fit under the cloak anymore.” harry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. he stood up. at once kreacher hurried forward. “master has not finished his soup would master prefer the savory stew or else the treacle tart to which master is so partial?” “thanks kreacher but i’ll be back in a minute — er — bathroom.” aware that hermione was watching him suspiciously harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. grunting with pain he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes. ... he was gliding along a twilit street. the buildings on either side of him had high timbered gables they looked like gingerbread houses. he approached one of them then saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. he knocked. he felt a mounting excitement. ... the door opened a laughing woman stood there. her face fell as she looked into harry’s face humor gone terror replacing it. ... “gregorovitch?” said a high cold voice. she shook her head she was trying to close the door. a white hand held it steady prevented her shutting him out. ... “i want gregorovitch.” “er wohnt hier nicht mehr\” she cried shaking her head. “he no live here! he no live here! i know him not!” abandoning the attempt to close the door she began to back away down the dark hall and harry followed gliding toward her and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand. “where is he?” “das weifi ich nichti he move! i know not i know not!” he raised the wand. she screamed. two young children came running into the hall. she tried to shield them with her arms. there was a flash of green light — “harry! harry!” he opened his eyes he had sunk to the floor. hermione was pounding on the door again. “harry open up!” he had shouted out he knew it. he got up and unbolted the door hermione toppled inside at once regained her balance and looked around suspiciously. ron was right behind her looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom. “what were you doing?” asked hermione sternly. “what d’you think i was doing?” asked harry with feeble bravado. “you were yelling your head off!” said ron. “oh yeah ... i must’ve dozed off or — ” “harry please don’t insult our intelligence,” said hermione taking deep breaths. “we know your scar hurt downstairs and you’re white as a sheet.” harry sat down on the edge of the bath. “fine. i’ve just seen voldemort murdering a woman. by now he’s probably killed her whole family. and he didn’t need to. it was cedric all over again they were just there. ...” “harry you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore!” hermione cried her voice echoing through the bathroom. “dumbledore wanted you to use occlumency! he thought the connection was dangerous — voldemort can use it harry! what good is it to watch him kill and torture how can it help?” “because it means i know what he’s doing,” said harry. “so you’re not even going to try to shut him out?” “hermione i can’t. you know i’m lousy at occlumency i never got the hang of it.” “you never really tried!” she said hotly. “i don’t get it harry — do you like having this special connection or relationship or what — whatever — ” she faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. “like it?” he said quietly. “would you like it?” “i — no — i’m sorry harry i didn’t mean — ” “i hate it i hate the fact that he can get inside me that i have to watch him when he’s most dangerous. but i’m going to use it.” “dumbledore — ” “forget dumbledore. this is my choice nobody else’s. i want to know why he’s after gregorovitch.” “who?” “he’s a foreign wandmaker,” said harry. “he made krum’s wand and krum reckons he’s brilliant.” “but according to you,” said ron “voldemort’s got ollivander locked up somewhere. if he’s already got a wandmaker what does he need another one for?” “maybe he agrees with krum maybe he thinks gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me because ollivander didn’t know.” harry glanced into the cracked dusty mirror and saw ron and hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back. “harry you keep talking about what your wand did,” said hermione “but you made it happen! why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?” “because i know it wasn’t me! and so does voldemort hermione! we both know what really happened!” they glared at each other harry knew that he had not convinced hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into voldemort’s mind. to his relief ron intervened. “drop it,” he advised her. “it’s up to him. and if we’re going to the ministry tomorrow don’t you reckon we should go over the plan?” reluctantly as the other two could tell hermione let the matter rest though harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. in the meantime they returned to the basement kitchen where kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart. they did not get to bed until late that night after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it word perfect to each other. harry who was now sleeping in sirius’s room lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father sirius lupin and pettigrew and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. as he extinguished his wand however he was thinking not of polyjuice potion puking pastilles or the navy blue robes of magical maintenance he thought of gregorovitch the wandmaker and how long he could hope to remain hidden while voldemort sought him so determinedly. dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste. “you look terrible,” was ron’s greeting as he entered the room to wake harry. “not for long,” said harry yawning. they found hermione downstairs in the kitchen. she was being served coffee and hot rolls by kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that harry associated with exam review. “robes,” she said under her breath acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag “polyjuice potion ... invisibility cloak ... decoy detonators ... you should each take a couple just in case. ... puking pastilles nosebleed nougat extendable ears ...” they gulped down their breakfast then set off upstairs kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. “bless him,” said ron fondly “and when you think i used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.” they made their way onto the front step with immense caution they could see a couple of puffy eyed death eaters watching the house from across the misty square. hermione disapparated with ron first then came back for harry. after the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. it was as yet deserted except for a couple of large bins the first ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o’clock. “right then,” said hermione checking her watch. “she ought to be here in about five minutes. when i’ve stunned her — ” “hermione we know,” said ron sternly. “and i thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?” hermione squealed. “i nearly forgot! stand back — ” she pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them which burst open with a crash. the dark corridor behind it led as they knew from their careful scouting trips into an empty theater. hermione pulled the door back toward her to make it look as though it was still closed. “and now,” she said turning back to face the other two in the alleyway “we put on the cloak again — ” “ — and we wait,” ron finished throwing it over hermione ’s head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at harry. little more than a minute later there was a tiny pop and a little ministry witch with flyaway gray hair apparated feet from them blinking a little in the sudden brightness the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. she barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth however before hermione ’s silent stunning spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over. “nicely done hermione,” said ron emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as harry took off the invisibility cloak. together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head and added them to a flask of muddy polyjuice potion she had taken from the beaded bag. ron was rummaging through the little witch’s handbag. “she’s mafalda hopkirk,” he said reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the improper use of magic office. “you’d better take this hermione and here are the tokens.” he passed her several small golden coins all embossed with the letters m.o.m. which he had taken from the witch’s purse. hermione drank the polyjuice potion which was now a pleasant heliotrope color and within seconds stood before them the double of mafalda hopkirk. as she removed mafalda’s spectacles and put them on harry checked his watch. “we’re running late mr. magical maintenance will be here any second.” they hurried to close the door on the real mafalda harry and ron threw the invisibility cloak over themselves but hermione remained in view waiting. seconds later there was another pop and a small ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them. “oh hello mafalda.” “hello!” said hermione in a quavery voice. “how are you today?” “not so good actually,” replied the little wizard who looked thoroughly downcast. as hermione and the wizard headed for the main road harry and ron crept along behind them. “i’m sorry to hear you’re under the weather,” said hermione talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems it was essential to stop him from reaching the street. “here have a sweet.” “eh oh no thanks — ” “i insist!” said hermione aggressively shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. looking rather alarmed the little wizard took one. the effect was instantaneous. the moment the pastille touched his tongue the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head. “oh dear!” she said as he splattered the alley with sick. “perhaps you’d better take the day off!” “no — no!” he choked and retched trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. “i must — today — must go — ” “but that’s just silly!” said hermione alarmed. “you can’t go to work in this state — i think you ought to go to st. mungo’s and get them to sort you out!” the wizard had collapsed heaving onto all fours still trying to crawl toward the main street. “you simply can’t go to work like this!” cried hermione. at last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. using a repulsed hermione to claw his way back into a standing position he turned on the spot and vanished leaving nothing behind but the bag ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit. “urgh,” said hermione holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick. “it would have made much less mess to stun him too.” “yeah,” said ron emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard’s bag “but i still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. keen on his job though isn’t he chuck us the hair and the potion then.” within two minutes ron stood before them as small and ferrety as the sick wizard and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. “weird he wasn’t wearing them today wasn’t it seeing how much he wanted to go anyway i’m reg cattermole according to the label in the back.” “now wait here,” hermione told harry who was still under the invisibility cloak “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.” he had to wait ten minutes but it seemed much longer to harry skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the stunned mafalda. finally ron and hermione reappeared. “we don’t know who he is,” hermione said passing harry several curly black hairs “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! here he’s pretty tall you’ll need bigger robes. ...” she pulled out a set of the old robes kreacher had laundered for them and harry retired to take the potion and change. once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms powerfully built. he also had a beard. stowing the invisibility cloak and his glasses inside his new robes he rejoined the other two. “blimey that’s scary,” said ron looking up at harry who now towered over him. “take one of mafalda’s tokens,” hermione told harry “and let’s go it’s nearly nine.” they stepped out of the alleyway together. fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of steps one labeled gentlemen the other ladies. “see you in a moment then,” said hermione nervously and she tottered off down the steps to ladies. harry and ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet tiled in grimy black and white. “morning reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. “blooming pain in the bum this eh forcing us all to get to work this way! who are they expecting to turn up harry potter?” the wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. ron gave a forced chuckle. “yeah,” he said “stupid isn’t it?” and he and harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. to harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. he crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. he looked left and saw ron blinking at him. “we have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered. “looks like it,” harry whispered back his voice came out deep and gravelly. they both stood up. feeling exceptionally foolish harry clambered into the toilet. he knew at once that he had done the right thing though he appeared to be standing in water his shoes feet and robes remained quite dry. he reached up pulled the chain and next moment had zoomed down a short chute emerging out of a fireplace into the ministry of magic. he got up clumsily there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. the great atrium seemed darker than harry remembered it. previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. it was rather frightening this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones looking down at the ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words magic is might. harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him. “out of the way can’t y — oh sorry runcorn!” clearly frightened the balding wizard hurried away. apparently the man whom harry was impersonating runcorn was intimidating. “psst!” said a voice and he looked around to see a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from magical maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. harry hastened to join them. “you got in all right then?” hermione whispered to harry. “no he’s still stuck in the bog,” said ron. “oh very funny ... it’s horrible isn’t it?” she said to harry who was staring up at the statue. “have you seen what they’re sitting on harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies men women and children all with rather stupid ugly faces twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards. “muggles,” whispered hermione. “in their rightful place. come on let’s get going.” they joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall looking around as surreptitiously as possible but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of dolores umbridge. they passed through the gates and into a smaller hall where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. they had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said “cattermole!” they looked around harry’s stomach turned over. one of the death eaters who had witnessed dumbledore’s death was striding toward them. the ministry workers beside them fell silent their eyes downcast harry could feel fear rippling through them. the man’s scowling slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent sweeping robes which were embroidered with much gold thread. someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically “morning yaxley!” yaxley ignored them. “i requested somebody from magical maintenance to sort out my office cattermole. it’s still raining in there.” ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene but nobody spoke. “raining ... in your office that’s — that’s not good is it?” ron gave a nervous laugh. yaxley’s eyes widened. “you think it’s funny cattermole do you?” a pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off. “no,” said ron “no of course — ” “you realize that i am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife cattermole in fact i’m quite surprised you’re not down there holding her hand while she waits. already given her up as a bad job have you probably wise. be sure and marry a pureblood next time.” hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. yaxley looked at her. she coughed feebly and turned away. “i — i — ” stammered ron. “but if my wife were accused of being a mudblood,” said yaxley “ — not that any woman i married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the head of the department of magical law enforcement needed a job doing i would make it my priority to do that job cattermole. do you understand me?” “yes,” whispered ron. “then attend to it cattermole and if my office is not completely dry within an hour your wife’s blood status will be in even graver doubt than it is now.” the golden grille before them clattered open. with a nod and unpleasant smile to harry who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of cattermole yaxley swept away toward another lift. harry ron and hermione entered theirs but nobody followed them it was as if they were infectious. the grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward. “what am i going to do?” ron asked the other two at once he looked stricken. “if i don’t turn up my wife — i mean cattermole ’s wife — ” “well come with you we should stick together — ” began harry but ron shook his head feverishly. “that’s mental we haven’t got much time. you two find umbridge i’ll go and sort out yaxley’s office — but how do i stop it raining?” “try finite incantatem,” said hermione at once “that should stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse if it doesn’t something’s gone wrong with an atmospheric charm which will be more difficult to fix so as an interim measure try impervius to protect his belongings — ” “say it again slowly — ” said ron searching his pockets desperately for a quill but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. a disembodied female voice said “level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau,” and the grilles slid open again admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift. “morning albert,” said a bushily whiskered man smiling at harry. he glanced over at ron and hermione as the lift creaked upward once more hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to ron. the wizard leaned toward harry leering and muttered “dirk cresswell eh from goblin liaison nice one albert. i’m pretty confident i’ll get his job now!” he winked. harry smiled back hoping that this would suffice. the lift stopped the grilles opened once more. “level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services,” said the disembodied witch’s voice. harry saw hermione give ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift followed by the other wizards leaving harry and hermione alone. the moment the golden door had closed hermione said very fast “actually harry i think i’d better go after him i don’t think he knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing — ” “level one minister of magic and support staff.” the golden grilles slid apart again and hermione gasped. four people stood before them two of them deep in conversation a longhaired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold and a squat toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest. the muggle-born registration commission “ah mafalda!” said umbridge looking at hermione. “travers sent you did he?” “y-yes,” squeaked hermione. “good youll do perfectly well.” umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. “that’s that problem solved minister if mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway.” she consulted her clipboard. “ten people today and one of them the wife of a ministry employee! tut tut ... even here in the heart of the ministry!” she stepped into the lift beside hermione as did the two wizards who had been listening to umbridge’s conversation with the minister. “we’ll go straight down mafalda you’ll find everything you need in the courtroom. good morning albert aren’t you getting out?” “yes of course,” said harry in runcorn’s deep voice. harry stepped out of the lift. the golden grilles clanged shut behind him. glancing over his shoulder harry saw hermione’s anxious face sinking back out of sight a tall wizard on either side of her umbridge’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. “what brings you up here runcorn?” asked the new minister of magic. his long black hair and beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes putting harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. “needed a quick word with,” harry hesitated for a fraction of a second “arthur weasley. someone said he was up on level one.” “ah,” said pius thicknesse. “has he been caught having contact with an undesirable?” “no,” said harry his throat dry. “no nothing like that.” “ah well. it’s only a matter of time,” said thicknesse. “if you ask me the blood traitors are as bad as the mudbloods. good day runcorn.” “good day minister.” harry watched thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. the moment the minister had passed out of sight harry tugged the invisibility cloak out from under his heavy black cloak threw it over himself and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. runcorn was so tall that harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden. panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. as he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door each bearing a small plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it the might of the ministry its complexity its impenetrability seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with ron and hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. they had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected they had not given a moment’s thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. now hermione was stuck in court proceedings which would undoubtedly last hours ron was struggling to do magic that harry was sure was beyond him a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome and he harry was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. he stopped walking leaned against a wall and tried to decide what to do. the silence pressed upon him there was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the muffliato charm had been cast over the place. her office must be up here harry thought. it seemed most unlikely that umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. he therefore set off along the corridor again passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him scribbling on a trail of parchment. now paying attention to the names on the doors harry turned a corner. halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. harry paused to watch them for the effect was quite mesmerizing. they were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. after a few seconds harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized that what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets — that the paper squares were pages which when assembled folded and magicked into place fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. harry crept closer although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. he examined it beneath the invisibility cloak. its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title mudbloods and the dangers they pose to a peaceful pure-blood society beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. there was no author’s name upon the pamphlet but again the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said still waving and twirling her wand “will the old hag be interrogating mudbloods all day does anyone know?” “careful,” said the wizard beside her glancing around nervously one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor. “what has she got magic ears as well as an eye now?” the witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers harry looked too and rage reared in him like a snake. where there might have been a peephole on a muggle front door a large round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood — an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known alastor moody. for a split second harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there he even forgot that he was invisible. he strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. it was not moving it gazed blindly upward frozen. the plaque beneath it read dolores umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister below that a slightly shinier new plaque read head of the muggle-born registration commission harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers though they were intent upon their work he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. he therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. crouching down beneath the cloak he placed the decoy detonator on the ground. it scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. a few moments later during which harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. the young witch in the front row shrieked pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up looking around for the source of the commotion. harry turned the doorknob stepped into umbridge’s office and closed the door behind him. he felt he had stepped back in time. the room was exactly like umbridge’s office at hogwarts lace draperies doilies and dried flowers covered every available surface. the walls bore the same ornamental plates each featuring a highly colored beribboned kitten gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. the desk was covered with a flouncy flowered cloth. behind mad-eye’s eye a telescopic attachment enabled umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door. harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the decoy detonator. he wrenched the telescope out of the door leaving a hole behind pulled the magical eyeball out of it and placed it in his pocket. then he turned to face the room again raised his wand and murmured “accio locket.” nothing happened but he had not expected it to no doubt umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. he therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers. he saw quills and notebooks and spellotape enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips but no sign of a locket. there was a filing cabinet behind the desk harry set to searching it. like filch ’s filing cabinets at hogwarts it was full of folders each labeled with a name. it was not until harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search mr. weasley’s file. he pulled it out and opened it. arthur weasley blood status pureblood but with unacceptable pro-muggle leanings. known member of the order of the phoenix. family wife pureblood seven children two youngest at hogwarts. nb youngest son currently at home seriously ill ministry inspectors have confirmed. security status tracked. all movements are being monitored. strong likelihood undesirable no. 1 will contact has stayed with weasley family previously “undesirable number one,” harry muttered under his breath as he replaced mr. weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. he had an idea he knew who that was and sure enough as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on the wall with the words undesirable no. 1 emblazoned across his chest. a little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. harry moved across to read it and saw that umbridge had written “to be punished.” angrier than ever he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. he gave the office one last sweeping look and his heart skipped a beat. dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up but realized the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book. harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat — the life and lies ofalbus dumbledore — nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest “by rita skeeter bestselling author of armando dippet master or moron?” harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other’s shoulders. dumbledore now with elbow-length hair had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on krum’s chin that had so annoyed ron. the boy who roared in silent amusement beside dumbledore had a gleeful wild look about him. his golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. harry wondered whether it was a young doge but before he could check the caption the door of the office opened. if thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered harry would not have had time to pull the invisibility cloak over himself. as it was he thought thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained quite still staring curiously at the place where harry had just vanished. perhaps deciding that all he had seen was dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book for harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. it sprang out and began scribbling a note to umbridge. very slowly hardly daring to breathe harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond. the pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the decoy detonator which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said “i bet it sneaked up here from experimental charms they’re so careless remember that poisonous duck?” speeding back toward the lifts harry reviewed his options. it had never been likely that the locket was here at the ministry and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. their priority now had to be to leave the ministry before they were exposed and try again another day. the first thing to do was to find ron and then they could work out a way of extracting hermione from the courtroom. the lift was empty when it arrived. harry jumped in and pulled off the invisibility cloak as it started its descent. to his enormous relief when it rattled to a halt at level two a soaking-wet and wild-eyed ron got in. “m-morning,” he stammered to harry as the lift set off again. “ron it’s me harry!” “harry! blimey i forgot what you looked like — why isn’t hermione with you?” “she had to go down to the courtrooms with umbridge she couldn’t refuse and — ” but before harry could finish the lift had stopped again the doors opened and mr. weasley walked inside talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill. ... i quite understand what you’re saying wakanda but i’m afraid i cannot be party to — ” mr. weasley broke off he had noticed harry. it was very strange to have mr. weasley glare at him with that much dislike. the lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more. “oh hello reg,” said mr. weasley looking around at the sound of steady dripping from ron’s robes. “isn’t your wife in for questioning today er — what’s happened to you why are you so wet?” “yaxley’s office is raining,” said ron. he addressed mr. weasley’s shoulder and harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other’s eyes. “i couldn’t stop it so they’ve sent me to get bernie — pillsworth i think they said — ” “yes a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said mr. weasley. “did you try meteolojinx recanto it worked for bletchley.” “meteolojinx recanto?” whispered ron. “no i didn’t. thanks d — i mean thanks arthur.” the lift doors opened the old witch with the anthill hair left and ron darted past her out of sight. harry made to follow him but found his path blocked as percy weasley strode into the lift his nose buried in some papers he was reading. not until the doors had clanged shut again did percy realize he was in a lift with his father. he glanced up saw mr. weasley turned radish red and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. for the second time harry tried to get out but this time found his way blocked by mr. weasley’s arm. “one moment runcorn.” the lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor mr. weasley said “i hear you laid information about dirk cresswell.” harry had the impression that mr. weasley’s anger was no less because of the brush with percy. he decided his best chance was to act stupid. “sorry?” he said. “don’t pretend runcorn,” said mr. weasley fiercely. “you tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree didn’t you?” “i — so what if i did?” said harry. “so dirk cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said mr. weasley quietly as the lift sank ever lower. “and if he survives azkaban you 11 have to answer to him not to mention his wife his sons and his friends “arthur,” harry interrupted “you know you’re being tracked don’t you?” “is that a threat runcorn?” said mr. weasley loudly. “no,” said harry “it’s a fact! they’re watching your every move — ” the lift doors opened. they had reached the atrium. mr. weasley gave harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. harry stood there shaken. he wished he was impersonating somebody other than runcorn. ... the lift doors clanged shut. harry pulled out the invisibility cloak and put it back on. he would try to extricate hermione on his own while ron was dealing with the raining office. when the doors opened he stepped out into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood paneled and carpeted corridors above. as the lift rattled away again harry shivered slightly looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the department of mysteries. he set off his destination not the black door but the doorway he remembered on the left-hand side which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. his mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them he still had a couple of decoy detonators but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door enter as runcorn and ask for a quick word with mafalda of course he did not know whether runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this and even if he managed it hermione ’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the ministry. . . . lost in thought he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him as if he were descending into fog. it was becoming colder and colder with every step he took a cold that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. and then he felt that stealing sense of despair of hopelessness filling him expanding inside him. ... dementors he thought. and as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. the dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall black hooded figures their faces completely hidden their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. the petrified muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. most of them were hiding their faces in their hands perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors’ greedy mouths. some were accompanied by families others sat alone. the dementors were gliding up and down in front of them and the cold and the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid themselves upon harry like a curse. fight it he told himself but he knew that he could not conjure a patronus here without revealing himself instantly. so he moved forward as silently as he could and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain but he forced himself to think of hermione and of ron who needed him. moving through the towering black figures was terrifying the eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed and he felt sure that they sensed him sensed perhaps a human presence that still had some hope some resilience. ... and then abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. “no no i’m half-blood i’m half-blood i tell you! my father was a wizard he was look him up arkie alderton he’s a well-known broomstick designer look him up i tell you — get your hands off me get your hands off—” “this is your final warning,” said umbridge’s soft voice magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate screams. “if you struggle you will be subjected to the dementor’s kiss.” the man’s screams subsided but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. “take him away,” said umbridge. two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom their rotting scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. they glided away down the corridor with him and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight. “next — mary cattermole,” called umbridge. a small woman stood up she was trembling from head to foot. her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long plain robes. her face was completely bloodless. as she passed the dementors harry saw her shudder. he did it instinctively without any sort of plan because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon as the door began to swing closed he slipped into the courtroom behind her. it was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. this one was much smaller though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. there were more dementors in here casting their freezing aura over the place they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform. here behind a balustrade sat umbridge with yaxley on one side of her and hermione quite as white-faced as mrs. cattermole on the other. at the foot of the platform a bright-silver long-haired cat prowled up and down up and down and harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors that was for the accused to feel not the accusers. “sit down,” said umbridge in her soft silky voice. mrs. cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform. the moment she had sat down chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there. “you are mary elizabeth cattermole?” asked umbridge. mrs. cattermole gave a single shaky nod. “married to reginald cattermole of the magical maintenance department?” mrs. cattermole burst into tears. “i don’t know where he is he was supposed to meet me here!” umbridge ignored her. “mother to maisie ellie and alfred cattermole?” mrs. cattermole sobbed harder than ever. “they’re frightened they think i might not come home “spare us,” spat yaxley. “the brats of mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.” mrs. cattermole’s sobs masked harry’s footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. the moment he had passed the place where the patronus cat patrolled he felt the change in temperature it was warm and comfortable here. the patronus he was sure was umbridge’s and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here in her element upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind umbridge yaxley and hermione taking a seat behind the latter. he was worried about making hermione jump. he thought of casting the muffliato charm upon umbridge and yaxley but even murmuring the word might cause hermione alarm. then umbridge raised her voice to address mrs. cattermole and harry seized his chance. “i’m behind you,” he whispered into hermione’s ear. as he had expected she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview but both umbridge and yaxley were concentrating upon mrs. cattermole and this went unnoticed. “a wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the ministry today mrs. cattermole,” umbridge was saying. “eight-and-three-quarter inches cherry unicorn-hair core. do you recognize that description?” mrs. cattermole nodded mopping her eyes on her sleeve. “could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?” “t-took?” sobbed mrs. cattermole. “i didn’t t-take it from anybody. i b-bought it when i was eleven years old. it — it — it — chose me.” she cried harder than ever. umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made harry want to attack her. she leaned forward over the barrier the better to observe her victim and something gold swung forward too and dangled over the void the locket. hermione had seen it she let out a little squeak but umbridge and yaxley still intent upon their prey were deaf to everything else. “no,” said umbridge “no i don’t think so mrs. cattermole. wands only choose witches or wizards. you are not a witch. i have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here — mafalda pass them to me.” umbridge held out a small hand she looked so toadlike at that moment that harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. hermione ’s hands were shaking with shock. she fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with mrs. cattermole’s name on it. “that’s — that’s pretty dolores,” she said pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of umbridge’s blouse. “what?” snapped umbridge glancing down. “oh yes — an old family heirloom,” she said patting the locket lying on her large bosom. “the s stands for selwyn. ... i am related to the selwyns. ... indeed there are few pure-blood families to whom i am not related. ... a pity,” she continued in a louder voice flicking through mrs. cattermole’s questionnaire “that the same cannot be said for you. ‘parents’ professions greengrocers.’ ” yaxley laughed jeeringly. below the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down and the dementors stood waiting in the corners. it was umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into harry’s brain and obliterated his sense of caution — that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials. he raised his wand not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the invisibility cloak and said “stupefyl” there was a flash of red light umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade mrs. cattermole’s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and down below the prowling silver cat vanished. ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind yaxley confused looked around for the source of the trouble and saw harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. he tried to draw his own wand but too late “stupefyl” yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. “harry!” “hermione if you think i was going to sit here and let her pretend — ” “harry mrs. cattermole!” harry whirled around throwing off the invisibility cloak down below the dementors had moved out of their corners they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair whether because the patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control they seemed to have abandoned restraint. mrs. cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back. “expecto patronum” the silver stag soared from the tip of harry’s wand and leaped toward the dementors which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. the stag’s light more powerful and more warming than the cat’s protection filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around and around the room. “get the horcrux,” harry told hermione. he ran back down the steps stuffing the invisibility cloak back into his bag and approached mrs. cattermole. “you?” she whispered gazing into his face. “but — but reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!” “did i?” muttered harry tugging at the chains binding her arms. “well i’ve had a change of heart. diffindol” nothing happened. “hermione how do i get rid of these chains?” “wait i’m trying something up here — ” “hermione we’re surrounded by dementors!” “i know that harry but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone — i need to duplicate it — geminio there ... that should fool her. ...” hermione came running downstairs. “let’s see. ... relashiol” the chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. mrs. cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before. “i don’t understand,” she whispered. “you’re going to leave here with us,” said harry pulling her to her feet. “go home grab your children and get out get out of the country if you’ve got to. disguise yourselves and run. you’ve seen how it is you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.” “harry,” said hermione “how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?” “patronuses,” said harry pointing his wand at his own the stag slowed and walked still gleaming brightly toward the door. “as many as we can muster do yours hermione.” “expec — expecto patronum,” said hermione. nothing happened. “it’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” harry told a completely bemused mrs. cattermole. “bit unfortunate really ... come on hermione. ...” “expecto patronum).” a silver otter burst from the end of hermione ’s wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag. “c’mon,” said harry and he led hermione and mrs. cattermole to the door. when the patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. harry looked around the dementors were falling back on both sides of them melding into the darkness scattering before the silver creatures. “it’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,” harry told the waiting muggle-borns who were dazzled by the light of the patronuses and still cowering slightly. “go abroad if you can. just get well away from the ministry. that’s the — er — new official position. now if you’ll just follow the patronuses you’ll be able to leave from the atrium.” they managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted but as they approached the lifts harry started to have misgivings. if they emerged into the atrium with a silver stag an otter soaring alongside it and twenty or so people half of them accused muggle-borns he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. he had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them. “reg!” screamed mrs. cattermole and she threw herself into ron’s arms. “runcorn let me out he attacked umbridge and yaxley and he’s told all of us to leave the country i think we’d better do it reg i really do let’s hurry home and fetch the children and — why are you so wet?” “water,” muttered ron disengaging himself. “harry they know there are intruders inside the ministry something about a hole in umbridge’s office door i reckon we’ve got five minutes if that — ” hermione ’s patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror-struck face to harry. “harry if we’re trapped here — !” “we won’t be if we move fast,” said harry. he addressed the silent group behind them who were all gawping at him. “who’s got wands?” about half of them raised their hands. “okay all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. we’ll need to be fast before they stop us. come on.” they managed to cram themselves into two lifts. harry’s patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. “level eight,” said the witch’s cool voice “atrium.” harry knew at once that they were in trouble. the atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace sealing them off. “harry!” squeaked hermione. “what are we going to — ” “stop!” harry thundered and the powerful voice of runcorn echoed through the atrium the wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. “follow me,” he whispered to the group of terrified muggle-borns who moved forward in a huddle shepherded by ron and hermione. “what’s up albert?” said the same balding wizard who had followed harry out of the fireplace earlier. he looked nervous. “this lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said harry with all the authority he could muster. the group of wizards in front of him looked at one another. “we’ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone — “ are you contradicting me?” harry blustered. “would you like me to have your family tree examined like i had dirk cresswell’s?” “sorry!” gasped the balding wizard backing away. “i didn’t mean nothing albert but i thought ... i thought they were in for questioning and ...” “their blood is pure,” said harry and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. “purer than many of yours i daresay. off you go,” he boomed to the muggle-borns who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. the ministry wizards hung back some looking confused others scared and resentful. then “mary!” mrs. cattermole looked over her shoulder. the real reg cattermole no longer vomiting but pale and wan had just come running out of a lift. “r-reg?” she looked from her husband to ron who swore loudly. the balding wizard gaped his head turning ludicrously from one reg cattermole to the other. “hey — what’s going on what is this?” “seal the exit! seal it!” yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the muggle-borns but mrs. cattermole had now vanished. as the balding wizard lifted his wand harry raised an enormous fist and punched him sending him flying through the air. “he’s been helping muggle-borns escape yaxley!” harry shouted. the balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar under cover of which ron grabbed mrs. cattermole pulled her into the still-open fireplace and disappeared. confused yaxley looked from harry to the punched wizard while the real reg cattermole screamed “my wife! who was that with my wife what’s going on?” harry saw yaxley’s head turn saw an inkling of the truth dawn in that brutish face. “come on!” harry shouted at hermione he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as yaxley’s curse sailed over harry’s head. they spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. harry flung open the door ron was standing there beside the sinks still wrestling with mrs. cattermole. “reg i don’t understand — ” “let go i’m not your husband you’ve got to go home!” there was a noise in the cubicle behind them harry looked around yaxley had just appeared. “let’s go!” harry yelled. he seized hermione by the hand and ron by the arm and turned on the spot. darkness engulfed them along with the sensation of compressing bands but something was wrong. ... hermione ’s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. he wondered whether he was going to suffocate he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were ron’s arm and hermione ’s fingers which were slowly slipping away. . . . and then he saw the door of number twelve grimmauld place with its serpent door knocker but before he could draw breath there was a scream and a flash of purple light hermione ’s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again. the thief harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green he had no idea what had happened he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. then an object twitched close to his face. he pushed himself onto his hands and knees ready to face some small fierce creature but saw that the object was ron’s foot. looking around harry saw that they and hermione were lying on a forest floor apparently alone. harry’s first thought was of the forbidden forest and for a moment even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of hogwarts his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to hagrid’s hut. however in the few moments it took for ron to give a low groan and harry to start crawling toward him he realized that this was not the forbidden forest the trees looked younger they were more widely spaced the ground clearer. he met hermione also on her hands and knees at ron’s head. the moment his eyes fell upon ron all other concerns fled harry’s mind for blood drenched the whole of ron’s left side and his face stood out grayish white against the leaf-strewn earth. the polyjuice potion was wearing off now ron was halfway between cattermole and himself in appearance his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left. “what’s happened to him?” “splinched,” said hermione her fingers already busy at ron’s sleeve where the blood was wettest and darkest. harry watched horrified as she tore open ron’s shirt. he had always thought of splinching as something comical but this . . . his insides crawled unpleasantly as hermione laid bare ron’s upper arm where a great chunk of flesh was missing scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. “harry quickly in my bag there’s a small bottle labeled ‘essence of dittany’ — ” “bag — right — ” harry sped to the place where hermione had landed seized the tiny beaded bag and thrust his hand inside it. at once object after object began presenting itself to his touch he felt the leather spines of books woolly sleeves of jumpers heels of shoes — “quickly\” he grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag. “accio dittany\” a small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag he caught it and hastened back to hermione and ron whose eyes were now half-closed strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids. “he’s fainted,” said hermione who was also rather pale she no longer looked like mafalda though her hair was still gray in places. “unstopper it for me harry my hands are shaking.” harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. the wound now looked several days old new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh. “wow,” said harry. “it’s all i feel safe doing,” said hermione shakily. “there are spells that would put him completely right but i daren’t try in case i do them wrong and cause more damage. ... he’s lost so much blood already. ...” “how did he get hurt i mean” — harry shook his head trying to clear it to make sense of whatever had just taken place — “why are we here i thought we were going back to grimmauld place?” hermione took a deep breath. she looked close to tears. “harry i don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there.” “what d’you — ” “as we disapparated yaxley caught hold of me and i couldn’t get rid of him he was too strong and he was still holding on when we arrived at grimmauld place and then — well i think he must have seen the door and thought we were stopping there so he slackened his grip and i managed to shake him off and i brought us here instead!” “but then where’s he hang on. ... you don’t mean he’s at grimmauld place he can’t get in there?” her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. “harry i think he can. i — i forced him to let go with a revulsion jinx but i’d already taken him inside the fidelius charm’s protection. since dumbledore died we’re secret-keepers so i’ve given him the secret haven’t i?” there was no pretending harry was sure she was right. it was a serious blow. if yaxley could now get inside the house there was no way that they could return. even now he could be bringing other death eaters in there by apparition. gloomy and oppressive though the house was it had been their one safe refuge even now that kreacher was so much happier and friendlier a kind of home. with a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney pie that harry ron and hermione would never eat. “harry i’m sorry i’m so sorry!” “don’t be stupid it wasn’t your fault! if anything it was mine. ...” harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out mad eye’s eye. hermione recoiled looking horrified. “umbridge had stuck it to her office door to spy on people. i couldn’t leave it there ... but that’s how they knew there were intruders.” before hermione could answer ron groaned and opened his eyes. he was still gray and his face glistened with sweat. “how d’you feel?” hermione whispered. “lousy,” croaked ron wincing as he felt his injured arm. “where are we?” “in the woods where they held the quidditch world cup,” said hermione. “i wanted somewhere enclosed undercover and this was — ” “ — the first place you thought of,” harry finished for her glancing around at the apparently deserted glade. he could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had apparated to the first place hermione had thought of — how death eaters had found them within minutes. had it been legilimency did voldemort or his henchmen know even now where hermione had taken them “d’you reckon we should move on?” ron asked harry and harry could tell by the look on ron’s face that he was thinking the same. “i dunno.” ron still looked pale and clammy. he had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. the prospect of moving him was daunting. “let’s stay here for now,” harry said. looking relieved hermione sprang to her feet. “where are you going?” asked ron. “if we’re staying we should put some protective enchantments around the place,” she replied and raising her wand she began to walk in a wide circle around harry and ron murmuring incantations as she went. harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air it was as if hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. “salvio hexia ... protego totalum ... repello muggletum ... muffliato ... you could get out the tent harry. ...” “tent?” “in the bag!” “in the ... of course,” said harry. he did not bother to grope inside it this time but used another summoning charm. the tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas rope and poles. harry recognized it partly because of the smell of cats as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the quidditch world cup. “i thought this belonged to that bloke perkins at the ministry?” he asked starting to disentangle the tent pegs. “apparently he didn’t want it back his lumbago’s so bad,” said hermione now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand “so ron’s dad said i could borrow it. erectov’ she added pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas which in one fluid motion rose into the air and settled fully constructed onto the ground before harry out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope. “ cave inimicum,” hermione finished with a skyward flourish. “that’s as much as i can do. at the very least we should know they’re coming i can’t guarantee it will keep out vol — ” “don’t say the name!” ron cut across her his voice harsh. harry and hermione looked at each other. “i’m sorry,” ron said moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them “but it feels like a — a jinx or something. can’t we call him you-know-who — please?” “dumbledore said fear of a name — ” began harry. “in case you hadn’t noticed mate calling you-know who by his name didn’t do dumbledore much good in the end,” ron snapped back. “just — just show you know-who some respect will you?” “respect?” harry repeated but hermione shot him a warning look apparently he was not to argue with ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. harry and hermione half carried half dragged ron through the entrance of the tent. the interior was exactly as harry remembered it a small flat complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. he shoved aside an old armchair and lowered ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. even this very short journey had turned ron whiter still and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while. “i’ll make some tea,” said hermione breathlessly pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen. harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that mad-eye had died it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. after a minute or two ron broke the silence. “what d’you reckon happened to the cattermoles?” “with any luck they’ll have got away,” said hermione clutching her hot mug for comfort. “as long as mr. cattermole had his wits about him he’ll have transported mrs. cattermole by side-along apparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. that’s what harry told her to do.” “blimey i hope they escaped,” said ron leaning back on his pillows. the tea seemed to be doing him good a little of his color had returned. “i didn’t get the feeling reg cattermole was all that quick-witted though the way everyone was talking to me when i was him. god i hope they made it. ... if they both end up in azkaban because of us ...” harry looked over at hermione and the question he had been about to ask — about whether mrs. cattermole ’s lack of a wand would prevent her apparating alongside her husband — died in his throat. hermione was watching ron fret over the fate of the cattermoles and there was such tenderness in her expression that harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him. “so have you got it?” harry asked her partly to remind her that he was there. “got — got what?” she said with a little start. “what did we just go through all that for the locket! where’s the locket?” “ you got it?” shouted ron raising himself a little higher on his pillows. “no one tells me anything! blimey you could have mentioned it!” “well we were running for our lives from the death eaters weren’t we?” said hermione. “here.” and she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to ron. it was as large as a chicken’s egg. an ornate letter s inlaid with many small green stones glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent’s canvas roof. “there isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since kreacher had it?” asked ron hopefully. “i mean are we sure it’s still a horcrux?” “i think so,” said hermione taking it back from him and looking at it closely. “there ’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.” she passed it to harry who turned it over in his fingers. the thing looked perfect pristine. he remembered the mangled remains of the diary and how the stone in the horcrux ring had been cracked open when dumbledore destroyed it. “i reckon kreacher’s right,” said harry. “we’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.” sudden awareness of what he was holding of what lived behind the little golden doors hit harry as he spoke. even after all their efforts to find it he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him. mastering himself again he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers then attempted the charm hermione had used to open regulus’s bedroom door. neither worked. he handed the locket back to ron and hermione each of whom did their best but were no more successful at opening it than he had been. “can you feel it though?” ron asked in a hushed voice as he held it tight in his clenched fist. “what d’you mean?” ron passed the horcrux to harry. after a moment or two harry thought he knew what ron meant. was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel or was it something beating inside the locket like a tiny metal heart “what are we going to do with it?” hermione asked. “keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” harry replied and little though he wanted to he hung the chain around his own neck dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes where it rested against his chest beside the pouch hagrid had given him. “i think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,” he added to hermione standing up and stretching. “and we’ll need to think about some food as well. you stay there,” he added sharply as ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green. with the sneakoscope hermione had given harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent harry and hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. however the sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day and whether because of the protective enchantments and muggle-repelling charms hermione had spread around them or because people rarely ventured this way their patch of wood remained deserted apart from occasional birds and squirrels. evening brought no change harry lit his wand as he swapped places with hermione at ten o’clock and looked out upon a deserted scene noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing. he felt hungry now and a little light-headed. hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag as she had assumed that they would be returning to grimmauld place that night so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan. after a couple of mouthfuls ron had pushed his portion away looking queasy harry had only persevered so as not to hurt hermione ’s feelings. the surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. his insides already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms tingled with unease. he had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the horcrux but somehow he did not all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness of which his wand lit only a tiny part was worry about what would happen next. it was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks months maybe even years but now he had come to an abrupt halt run out of road. there were other horcruxes out there somewhere but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. he did not even know what all of them were. meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found the horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. curiously it had not taken heat from his body but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. from time to time harry thought or perhaps imagined that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own. nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark he tried to resist them push them away yet they came at him relentlessly. neither can live while the other survives. ron and hermione now talking softly behind him in the tent could walk away if they wanted to he could not. and it seemed to harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion that the horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. ... stupid idea he told himself don’t think that. ... his scar was starting to prickle again. he was afraid that he was making it happen by having these thoughts and tried to direct them into another channel. he thought of poor kreacher who had expected them home and had received yaxley instead. would the elf keep silent or would he tell the death eater everything he knew harry wanted to believe that kreacher had changed toward him in the past month that he would be loyal now but who knew what would happen what if the death eaters tortured the elf sick images swarmed into harry’s head and he tried to push these away too for there was nothing he could do for kreacher he and hermione had already decided against trying to summon him what if someone from the ministry came too they could not count on elfish apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken yaxley to grimmauld place on the hem of hermione ’s sleeve. harry’s scar was burning now. he thought that there was so much they did not know lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. why hadn’t dumbledore explained more had he thought that there would be time that he would live for years for centuries perhaps like his friend nicolas flamel if so he had been wrong. ... snape had seen to that. ... snape the sleeping snake who had struck at the top of the tower . . . and dumbledore had fallen ... fallen ... “ give it to me gregorovitch.” harry’s voice was high clear and cold his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white hand. the man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair though there were no ropes holding him he swung there invisibly and eerily bound his limbs wrapped about him his terrified face on a level with harry’s ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. he had pure-white hair and a thick bushy beard a trussed-up father christmas. “i have it not i have it no more! it was many years ago stolen from me!” “do not lie to lord voldemort gregorovitch. he knows. ... he always knows.” the hanging man’s pupils were wide dilated with fear and they seemed to swell bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed harry whole — and now harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little gregorovitch ’s wake as he held a lantern aloft gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light and there on the window ledge sat perched like a giant bird a young man with golden hair. in the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him harry saw the delight upon his handsome face then the intruder shot a stunning spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter. and harry was hurtling back out of those wide tunnellike pupils and gregorovitch ’s face was stricken with terror. “who was the thief gregorovitch?” said the high cold voice. “i do not know i never knew a young man — no — please — please !” a scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light — “ harryl ” he opened his eyes panting his forehead throbbing. he had passed out against the side of the tent had slid sideways down the canvas and was sprawled on the ground. he looked up at hermione whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them. “dream,” he said sitting up quickly and attempting to meet hermione ’s glower with a look of innocence. “must’ve dozed off sorry.” “i know it was your scar! i can tell by the look on your face! you were looking into vol — ” “don’t say his name!” came ron’s angry voice from the depths of the tent. “fine,” retorted hermione. “you-know-who’s mind then!” “i didn’t mean it to happen!” harry said. “it was a dream! can you control what you dream about hermione?” “if you just learned to apply occlumency — ” but harry was not interested in being told off he wanted to discuss what he had just seen. “he’s found gregorovitch hermione and i think he’s killed him but before he killed him he read gregorovitch ’s mind and i saw — ” “i think i’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” said hermione coldly. “i can finish the watch!” “no you’re obviously exhausted. go and lie down.” she dropped down in the mouth of the tent looking stubborn. angry but wishing to avoid a row harry ducked back inside. ron’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk harry climbed into the one above him lay down and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. after several moments ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to hermione huddled in the entrance. “what’s you-know-who doing?” harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail then whispered into the darkness. “he found gregorovitch. he had him tied up he was torturing him.” “how’s gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he’s tied up?” “i dunno. ... it’s weird isn’t it?” harry closed his eyes thinking of all he had seen and heard. the more he recalled the less sense it made. ... voldemort had said nothing about harry’s wand nothing about the twin cores nothing about gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat harry’s. ... “he wanted something from gregorovitch,” harry said eyes still closed tight. “he asked him to hand it over but gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him ... and then ... then ...” he remembered how he as voldemort had seemed to hurtle through gregorovitch ’s eyes into his memories. ... “he read gregorovitch ’s mind and i saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill and he fired a curse at gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. he stole it he stole whatever you-know-who’s after. and i ... i think i’ve seen him somewhere. ...” harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy’s face. the theft had happened many years ago according to gregorovitch. why did the young thief look familiar the noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent all harry could hear was ron’s breathing. after a while ron whispered “couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?” “no ... it must’ve been something small.” “harry?” the wooden slats of ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. “harry you don’t reckon you-know-who’s after something else to turn into a horcrux?” “i don’t know,” said harry slowly. “maybe. but wouldn’t it be dangerous for him to make another one didn’t hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?” “yeah but maybe he doesn’t know that.” “yeah ... maybe,” said harry. he had been sure that voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores sure that voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. what was voldemort trying to find why with the ministry of magic and the wizarding world at his feet was he far away intent on the pursuit of an object that gregorovitch had once owned and which had been stolen by the unknown thief harry could still see the blond-haired youth’s face it was merry wild there was a fred and george-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. he had soared from the windowsill like a bird and harry had seen him before but he could not think where. ... with gregorovitch dead it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now and it was on him that harry’s thoughts dwelled as ron’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more. the goblin’s revenge early next morning before the other two were awake harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest most gnarled and resilient-looking tree he could find. there in its shadow he buried mad-eye moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. it was not much but harry felt that mad-eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on dolores umbridge’s door. then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake and discuss what they were going to do next. harry and hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long and ron agreed with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing while harry and ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. then they disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments harry ventured out under the invisibility cloak to find sustenance. this however did not go as planned. he had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill a descending mist and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood. “but you can make a brilliant patronus!” protested ron when harry arrived back at the tent empty handed out of breath and mouthing the single word dementors. “i couldn’t ... make one,” he panted clutching the stitch in his side. “wouldn’t ... come.” their expressions of consternation and disappointment made harry feel ashamed. it had been a nightmarish experience seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears that he was not going to be able to protect himself. it had taken all harry’s willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the muggles who might not be able to see them but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went. “so we still haven’t got any food.” “shut up ron,” snapped hermione. “harry what happened why do you think you couldn’t make your patronus you managed perfectly yesterday!” “i don’t know.” he sat low in one of perkins’s old armchairs feeling more humiliated by the moment. he was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. yesterday seemed a long time ago today he might have been thirteen years old again the only one who collapsed on the hogwarts express. ron kicked a chair leg. “what?” he snarled at hermione. “i’m starving! all i’ve had since i bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!” “you go and fight your way through the dementors then,” said harry stung. “i would but my arm’s in a sling in case you hadn’t noticed!” “that’s convenient.” “and what’s that supposed to — ” “of course!” cried hermione clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. “harry give me the locket! come on,” she said impatiently clicking her fingers at him when he did not react “the horcrux harry you’re still wearing it!” she held out her hands and harry lifted the golden chain over his head. the moment it parted contact with harry’s skin he felt free and oddly light. he had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted. “better?” asked hermione. “yeah loads better!” “harry,” she said crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick “you don’t think you’ve been possessed do you?” “what no!” he said defensively. “i remember everything we’ve done while i’ve been wearing it. i wouldn’t know what i’d done if i’d been possessed would i ginny told me there were times when she couldn’t remember anything.” “hmm,” said hermione looking down at the heavy gold locket. “well maybe we ought not to wear it. we can just keep it in the tent.” “we are not leaving that horcrux lying around,” harry stated firmly. “if we lose it if it gets stolen — ” “oh all right all right,” said hermione and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. “but we’ll take turns wearing it so nobody keeps it on too long.” “great,” said ron irritably “and now we’ve sorted that out can we please get some food?” “fine but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said hermione with half a glance at harry. “there’s no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.” in the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely farm from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. “it’s not stealing is it?” asked hermione in a troubled voice as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. “not if i left some money under the chicken coop?” ron rolled his eyes and said with his cheeks bulging “ ’er-my-nee ’oo worry ’oo much. ’elax!” and indeed it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed the argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night and harry felt cheerful even hopeful as he took the first of the three night watches. this was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits an empty one bickering and gloom. harry was least surprised by this because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the dursleys’. hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. ron however had always been used to three delicious meals a day courtesy of his mother or of the hogwarts house-elves and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. whenever lack of food coincided with ron’s turn to wear the horcrux he became downright unpleasant. “so where next?” was his constant refrain. he did not seem to have any ideas himself but expected harry and hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. accordingly harry and hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other horcruxes and how to destroy the one they had already got their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information. as dumbledore had told harry that he believed voldemort had hidden the horcruxes in places important to him they kept reciting in a sort of dreary litany those locations they knew that voldemort had lived or visited. the orphanage where he had been born and raised hogwarts where he had been educated borgin and burkes where he had worked after completing school then albania where he had spent his years of exile these formed the basis of their speculations. “yeah let’s go to albania. shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,” said ron sarcastically. “there can’t be anything there. he’d already made five of his horcruxes before he went into exile and dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,” said hermione. “we know the snake’s not in albania it’s usually with vol — ” “didn’t i ask you to stop saying that?” “fine! the snake is usually with you-knotu-who — happy?” “not particularly.” “i can’t see him hiding anything at borgin and burkes,” said harry who had made this point many times before but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. “borgin and burke were experts at dark objects they would’ve recognized a horcrux straightaway.” ron yawned pointedly. repressing a strong urge to throw something at him harry plowed on “i still reckon he might have hidden something at hogwarts.” hermione sighed. “but dumbledore would have found it harry!” harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. “dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of hogwarts’s secrets. i’m telling you if there was one place vol — ” “oi!” “you-know-who then!” harry shouted goaded past endurance. “if there was one place that was really important to you-know-who it was hogwarts!” “oh come on,” scoffed ron. “his school?” “yeah his school! it was his first real home the place that meant he was special it meant everything to him and even after he left — ” “this is you-know-who we’re talking about right not you?” inquired ron. he was tugging at the chain of the horcrux around his neck harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him. “you told us that you-know-who asked dumbledore to give him a job after he left,” said hermione. “that’s right,” said harry. “and dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something probably another founder’s object to make into another horcrux?” “yeah,” said harry. “but he didn’t get the job did he?” said hermione. “so he never got the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the school!” “okay then,” said harry defeated. “forget hogwarts.” without any other leads they traveled into london and hidden beneath the invisibility cloak searched for the orphanage in which voldemort had been raised. hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. they visited its site and found a tower block of offices. “we could try digging in the foundations?” hermione suggested halfheartedly. “he wouldn’t have hidden a horcrux here,” harry said. he had known it all along the orphanage had been the place voldemort had been determined to escape he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. dumbledore had shown harry that voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places this dismal gray corner of london was as far removed as you could imagine from hogwarts or the ministry or a building like gringotts the wizarding bank with its golden doors and marble floors. even without any new ideas they continued to move through the countryside pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot traveling by apparition to more woods to the shadowy crevices of cliffs to purple moors gorse-covered mountainsides and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. every twelve hours or so they passed the horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety. harry’s scar kept prickling. it happened most often he noticed when he was wearing the horcrux. sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. “what what did you see?” demanded ron whenever he noticed harry wince. “a face,” muttered harry every time. “the same face. the thief who stole from gregorovitch.” and ron would turn away making no effort to hide his disappointment. harry knew that ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the order of the phoenix but after all he harry was not a television aerial he could only see what voldemort was thinking at the time not tune in to whatever took his fancy. apparently voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face whose name and whereabouts harry felt sure voldemort knew no better than he did. as harry’s scar continued to burn and the merry blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. he could not entirely blame them when they were so desperate for a lead on the horcruxes. as the days stretched into weeks harry began to suspect that ron and hermione were having conversations without and about him. several times they stopped talking abruptly when harry entered the tent and twice he came accidentally upon them huddled a little distance away heads together and talking fast both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood and harry was starting to fear that hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. in desperation he tried to think of further horcrux locations but the only one that continued to occur to him was hogwarts and as neither of the others thought this at all likely he stopped suggesting it. autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it they were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. natural mists joined those cast by the dementors wind and rain added to their troubles. the fact that hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation the lack of other people’s company or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against voldemort. “my mother,” said ron one night as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in wales “can make good food appear out of thin air.” he prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. harry glanced automatically at ron’s neck and saw as he had expected the golden chain of the horcrux glinting there. he managed to fight down the impulse to swear at ron whose attitude would he knew improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket. “your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said hermione. “no one can. food is the first of the five principal exceptions to gamp’s law of elemental transfigur — ” “oh speak english can’t you?” ron said prising a fish bone out from between his teeth. “it’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! you can summon it if you know where it is you can transform it you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got some — ” “well don’t bother increasing this it’s disgusting,” said ron. “harry caught the fish and i did my best with it! i notice i’m always the one who ends up sorting out the food because i’m a girl i suppose!” “no it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!” shot back ron. hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor. “ you can do the cooking tomorrow ron you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating and i’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you — ” “shut up!” said harry leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. “shut up now\” hermione looked outraged. “how can you side with him he hardly ever does the cook — ” “hermione be quiet i can hear someone!” he was listening hard his hands still raised warning them not to talk. then over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them he heard voices again. he looked around at the sneakoscope. it was not moving. “you cast the muffliato charm over us right?” he whispered to hermione. “i did everything,” she whispered back “muffliato muggle-repelling and disillusionment charms all of it. they shouldn’t be able to hear or see us whoever they are.” heavy scuffing and scraping noises plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs told them that several people were clambering down the steep wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. they drew their wands waiting. the enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient in the near total darkness to shield them from the notice of muggles and normal witches and wizards. if these were death eaters then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by dark magic for the first time. the voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage after a moment she drew out three extendable ears and threw one each to harry and ron who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance. within seconds harry heard a weary male voice. “there ought to be a few salmon in here or d’you reckon it’s too early in the season accio salmon).” there were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. somebody grunted appreciatively. harry pressed the extendable ear deeper into his own over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices but they were not speaking english or any human language he had ever heard. it was a rough and unmelodious tongue a string of rattling guttural noises and there seemed to be two speakers one with a slightly lower slower voice than the other. a fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas large shadows passed between tent and flames. the delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. then came the clinking of cutlery on plates and the first man spoke again. “here griphook gornuk.” goblins hermione mouthed at harry who nodded. “thank you,” said the goblins together in english. “so you three have been on the run how long?” asked a new mellow and pleasant voice it was vaguely familiar to harry who pictured a round-bellied cheerful-faced man. “six weeks ... seven ... i forget,” said the tired man. “met up with griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with gornuk not long after. nice to have a bit of company.” there was a pause while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. “what made you leave ted?” continued the man. “knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow voiced ted and harry suddenly knew who he was tonks’s father. “heard death eaters were in the area last week and decided i’d better run for it. refused to register as a muggle-born on principle see so i knew it was a matter of time knew i’d have to leave in the end. my wife should be okay she’s pure-blood. and then i met dean here what a few days ago son?” “yeah,” said another voice and harry ron and hermione stared at each other silent but beside themselves with excitement sure they recognized the voice of dean thomas their fellow gryffindor. “muggle-born eh?” asked the first man. “not sure,” said dean. “my dad left my mum when i was a kid. i’ve got no proof he was a wizard though.” there was silence for a while except for the sounds of munching then ted spoke again. “i’ve got to say dirk i’m surprised to run into you. pleased but surprised. word was you’d been caught.” “i was,” said dirk. “i was halfway to azkaban when i made a break for it stunned dawlish and nicked his broom. it was easier than you’d think i don’t reckon he’s quite right at the moment. might be confunded. if so i’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it probably saved my life.” there was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. then ted said “and where do you two fit in i er had the impression the goblins were for you-know-who on the whole.” “you had a false impression,” said the higher-voiced of the goblins. “we take no sides. this is a wizards’ war.” “how come you’re in hiding then?” “i deemed it prudent,” said the deeper-voiced goblin. “having refused what i considered an impertinent request i could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.” “what did they ask you to do?” asked ted. “duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin his voice rougher and less human as he said it. “i am not a house-elf.” “what about you griphook?” “similar reasons,” said the higher-voiced goblin. “gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. i recognize no wizarding master.” he added something under his breath in gobbledegook and gornuk laughed. “what’s the joke?” asked dean. “he said,” replied dirk “that there are things wizards don’t recognize either.” there was a short pause. “i don’t get it,” said dean. “i had my small revenge before i left,” said griphook in english. “good man — goblin i should say,” amended ted hastily. “didn’t manage to lock a death eater up in one of the old high-security vaults i suppose?” “if i had the sword would not have helped him break out,” replied griphook. gornuk laughed again and even dirk gave a dry chuckle. “dean and i are still missing something here,” said ted. “so is severus snape though he does not know it,” said griphook and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. inside the tent harry’s breathing was shallow with excitement he and hermione stared at each other listening as hard as they could. “didn’t you hear about that ted?” asked dirk. “about the kids who tried to steal gryffindor’s sword out of snape ’s office at hogwarts?” an electric current seemed to course through harry jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot. “never heard a word,” said ted. “not in the prophet was it?” “hardly,” chortled dirk. “griphook here told me he heard about it from bill weasley who works for the bank. one of the kids who tried to take the sword was bill’s younger sister.” harry glanced toward hermione and ron both of whom were clutching the extendable ears as tightly as lifelines. “she and a couple of friends got into snape ’s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.” “ah god bless ’em,” said ted. “what did they think that they’d be able to use the sword on you-know who or on snape himself?” “well whatever they thought they were going to do with it snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said dirk. “couple of days later once he’d got the say-so from you-know-who i imagine he sent it down to london to be kept in gringotts instead.” the goblins started to laugh again. “i’m still not seeing the joke,” said ted. “it’s a fake,” rasped griphook. “the sword of gryffindor!” “oh yes. it is a copy — an excellent copy it is true — but it was wizard-made. the original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. wherever the genuine sword of gryffindor is it is not in a vault at gringotts bank.” “i see,” said ted. “and i take it you didn’t bother telling the death eaters this?” “i saw no reason to trouble them with the information,” said griphook smugly and now ted and dean joined in gornuk and dirk’s laughter. inside the tent harry closed his eyes willing someone to ask the question he needed answered and after a minute that seemed ten dean obliged he was harry remembered with a jolt an ex-boyfriend of ginny’s too. “what happened to ginny and the others the ones who tried to steal it?” “oh they were punished and cruelly,” said griphook indifferently. “they’re okay though?” asked ted quickly. “i mean the weasleys don’t need any more of their kids injured do they?” “they suffered no serious injury as far as i am aware,” said griphook. “lucky for them,” said ted. “with snape’s track record i suppose we should just be glad they’re still alive.” “you believe that story then do you ted?” asked dirk. “you believe snape killed dumbledore?” “ ’course i do,” said ted. “you’re not going to sit there and tell me you think potter had anything to do with it?” “hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered dirk. “i know harry potter,” said dean. “and i reckon he’s the real thing — the chosen one or whatever you want to call it.” “yeah there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that son,” said dirk “me included. but where is he run for it by the looks of things. you’d think if he knew anything we don’t or had anything special going for him he’d be out there now fighting rallying resistance instead of hiding. and you know the prophet made a pretty good case against him — ” “the prophet?” scoffed ted. “you deserve to be lied to if you’re still reading that muck dirk. you want the facts try the quibbler.” there was a sudden explosion of choking and retching plus a good deal of thumping by the sound of it dirk had swallowed a fish bone. at last he spluttered “the quibbler that lunatic rag of xeno lovegood’s?” “it’s not so lunatic these days,” said ted. “you want to give it a look. xeno is printing all the stuff the prophet’s ignoring not a single mention of crumple horned snorkacks in the last issue. how long they’ll let him get away with it mind i don’t know. but xeno says front page of every issue that any wizard who’s against you-know-who ought to make helping harry potter their number-one priority.” “hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the earth,” said dirk. “listen the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an achievement,” said ted. “i’d take tips from him gladly it’s what we’re trying to do stay free isn’t it?” “yeah well you’ve got a point there,” said dirk heavily. “with the whole of the ministry and all their informers looking for him i’d have expected him to be caught by now. mind who’s to say they haven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?” “ah don’t say that dirk,” murmured ted. there was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. when they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. deciding the trees would give better cover they extinguished their fire then clambered back up the incline their voices fading away. harry ron and hermione reeled in the extendable ears. harry who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped now found himself unable to say more than “ginny — the sword — ” “i know!” said hermione. she lunged for the tiny beaded bag this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit. “here ... we ... are ...” she said between gritted teeth and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. harry hurried to help her. as they lifted the empty portrait of phineas nigellus free of hermione’s bag she kept her wand pointing at it ready to cast a spell at any moment. “if somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in dumbledore’s office,” she panted as they propped the painting against the side of the tent “phineas nigellus would have seen it happen he hangs right beside the case!” “unless he was asleep,” said harry but he still held his breath as hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas her wand directed at its center cleared her throat then said “er — phineas phineas nigellus?” nothing happened. “phineas nigellus?” said hermione again. “professor black please could we talk to you please?” “ ‘please’ always helps,” said a cold snide voice and phineas nigellus slid into his portrait. at once hermione cried “obscuro\” a black blindfold appeared over phineas nigellus’s clever dark eyes causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain. “what — how dare — what are you — ” “i’m very sorry professor black,” said hermione “but it’s a necessary precaution!” “remove this foul addition at once! remove it i say! you are ruining a great work of art! where am i what is going on?” “never mind where we are,” said harry and phineas nigellus froze abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold. “can that possibly be the voice of the elusive mr. potter?” “maybe,” said harry knowing that this would keep phineas nigellus’s interest. “we’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about the sword of gryffindor.” “ah,” said phineas nigellus now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of harry “yes. that silly girl acted most unwisely there — ” “shut up about my sister,” said ron roughly. phineas nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows. “who else is here?” he asked turning his head from side to side. “your tone displeases me! the girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. thieving from the headmaster!” “they weren’t thieving,” said harry. “that sword isn’t snape’s.” “it belongs to professor snape’s school,” said phineas nigellus. “exactly what claim did the weasley girl have upon it she deserved her punishment as did the idiot longbottom and the lovegood oddity!” “neville is not an idiot and luna is not an oddity!” said hermione. “where am i?” repeated phineas nigellus starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. “where have you brought me why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?” “never mind that! how did snape punish ginny neville and luna?” asked harry urgently. “professor snape sent them into the forbidden forest to do some work for the oaf hagrid.” “hagrid’s not an oaf!” said hermione shrilly. “and snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said harry “but ginny neville and luna probably had a good laugh with hagrid. the forbidden forest ... they’ve faced plenty worse than the forbidden forest big deal!” he felt relieved he had been imagining horrors the cruciatus curse at the very least. “what we really wanted to know professor black is whether anyone else has um taken out the sword at all maybe it’s been taken away for cleaning or — or something?” phineas nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. “ muggle-borns,” he said. “goblin-made armor does not require cleaning simple girl. goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt imbibing only that which strengthens it.” “don’t call hermione simple,” said harry. “i grow weary of contradiction,” said phineas nigellus. “perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office?” still blindfolded he began groping the side of his frame trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at hogwarts. harry had a sudden inspiration. “dumbledore! can’t you bring us dumbledore?” “i beg your pardon?” asked phineas nigellus. “professor dumbledore’s portrait — couldn’t you bring him along here into yours?” phineas nigellus turned his face in the direction of harry’s voice. “evidently it is not only muggle-borns who are ignorant potter. the portraits of hogwarts may commune with each other but they cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere. dumbledore cannot come here with me and after the treatment i have received at your hands i can assure you that i shall not be making a return visit!” slightly crestfallen harry watched phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame. “professor black,” said hermione “couldn’t you just tell us please when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case before ginny took it out i mean?” phineas snorted impatiently. “i believe that the last time i saw the sword of gryffindor leave its case was when professor dumbledore used it to break open a ring.” hermione whipped around to look at harry. neither of them dared say more in front of phineas nigellus who had at last managed to locate the exit. “well good night to you,” he said a little waspishly and he began to move out of sight again. only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when harry gave a sudden shout. “wait! have you told snape you saw this?” phineas nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. “professor snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of albus dumbledore. good-bye potter!” and with that he vanished completely leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop. “harry!” hermione cried. “i know!” harry shouted. unable to contain himself he punched the air it was more than he had dared to hope for. he strode up and down the tent feeling that he could have run a mile he did not even feel hungry anymore. hermione was squashing phineas nigellus’s portrait back into the beaded bag when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to harry. “the sword can destroy horcruxes! goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthen them — harry that sword’s impregnated with basilisk venom!” “and dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it he wanted to use it on the locket — ” “ — and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put it in his will — ” “ — so he made a copy — ” “ — and put a fake in the glass case — ” “ — and he left the real one — where?” they gazed at each other harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them tantalizingly close. why hadn’t dumbledore told him or had he in fact told harry but harry had not realized it at the time “think!” whispered hermione. “think! where would he have left it?” “not at hogwarts,” said harry resuming his pacing. “somewhere in hogsmeade?” suggested hermione. “the shrieking shack?” said harry. “nobody ever goes in there.” “but snape knows how to get in wouldn’t that be a bit risky?” “dumbledore trusted snape,” harry reminded her. “not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said hermione. “yeah you’re right!” said harry and he felt even more cheered at the thought that dumbledore had had some reservations however faint about snape ’s trustworthiness. “so would he have hidden the sword well away from hogsmeade then what d’you reckon ron ron?” harry looked around. for one bewildered moment he thought that ron had left the tent then realized that ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk looking stony. “oh remembered me have you?” he said. “what?” ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. “you two carry on. don’t let me spoil your fun.” perplexed harry looked to hermione for help but she shook her head apparently as nonplussed as he was. “what’s the problem?” asked harry. “problem there’s no problem,” said ron still refusing to look at harry. “not according to you anyway.” there were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. it had started to rain. “well you’ve obviously got a problem,” said harry. “spit it out will you?” ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. he looked mean unlike himself. “all right i’ll spit it out. don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know.” “i don’t know?” repeated harry “i don’t know?” plunk plunk plunk. the rain was falling harder and heavier it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. dread doused harry’s jubilation ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking. “it’s not like i’m not having the time of my life here,” said ron “you know with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. i just hoped you know after we’d been running round a few weeks we’d have achieved something.” “ron,” hermione said but in such a quiet voice that ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent. “i thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said harry. “yeah i thought i did too.” “so what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations?” asked harry. anger was coming to his defense now. “did you think we’d be staying in five star hotels finding a horcrux every other day did you think you’d be back to mummy by christmas?” “we thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted ron standing up and his words pierced harry like scalding knives. “we thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan!” “ron!” said hermione this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof but again he ignored her. “well sorry to let you down,” said harry his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow inadequate. “i’ve been straight with you from the start i told you everything dumbledore told me. and in case you haven’t noticed we’ve found one horcrux — ” “yeah and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near in other words!” “take off the locket ron,” hermione said her voice unusually high. “please take it off. you wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day.” “yeah he would,” said harry who did not want excuses made for ron. “d’you think i haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back d’you think i didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff?” “harry we weren’t — ” “don’t lie!” ron hurled at her. “you said it too you said you were disappointed you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on than — ” “i didn’t say it like that — harry i didn’t!” she cried. the rain was pounding the tent tears were pouring down hermione’s face and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been a short-lived firework that had flared and died leaving everything dark wet and cold. the sword of gryffindor was hidden they knew not where and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not yet to be dead. “so why are you still here?” harry asked ron. “search me,” said ron. “go home then,” said harry. “yeah maybe i will!” shouted ron and he took several steps toward harry who did not back away. “didn’t you hear what they said about my sister but you don’t give a rat’s fart do you it’s only the forbidden forest harry i’ve-faced-worse potter doesn’t care what happens to her in here — well i do all right giant spiders and mental stuff — ” “i was only saying — she was with the others they were with hagrid — ” “yeah i get it you don’t care! and what about the rest of my family ‘the weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear that?” “yeah i — ” “not bothered what it meant though?” “ron!” said hermione forcing her way between them. “i don’t think it means anything new has happened anything we don’t know about think ron bill’s already scarred plenty of people must have seen that george has lost an ear by now and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit i’m sure that’s all he meant — ” “oh you’re sure are you right then well i won’t bother myself about them. it’s all right for you two isn’t it with your parents safely out of the way — ” “my parents are dead).” harry bellowed. “and mine could be going the same way!” yelled ron. “then go!” roared harry. “go back to them pretend you’ve got over your spattergroit and mummy’ll be able to feed you up and — ” ron made a sudden movement harry reacted but before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket hermione had raised her own. “protego\” she cried and an invisible shield expanded between her and harry on the one side and ron on the other all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell and harry and ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. harry felt a corrosive hatred toward ron something had broken between them. “leave the horcrux,” harry said. ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. he turned to hermione. “what are you doing?” “what do you mean?” “are you staying or what?” “i ...” she looked anguished. “yes — yes i’m staying. ron we said we’d go with harry we said we’d help — ” “i get it. you choose him.” “ron no — please — come back come back!” she was impeded by her own shield charm by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night. harry stood quite still and silent listening to her sobbing and calling ron’s name amongst the trees. after a few minutes she returned her sopping hair plastered to her face. “he’s g-g-gone! disapparated!” she threw herself into a chair curled up and started to cry. harry felt dazed. he stooped picked up the horcrux and placed it around his own neck. he dragged blankets off ron’s bunk and threw them over hermione. then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof listening to the pounding of the rain. godric’s hollow when harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened. then he hoped childishly that it had been a dream that ron was still there and had never left. yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see ron’s deserted bunk. it was like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes. harry jumped down from his own bed keeping his eyes averted from ron’s. hermione who was already busy in the kitchen did not wish harry good morning but turned her face away quickly as he went by. he’s gone harry told himself. he’s gone. he had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it. he’s gone and he’s not coming back. and that was the simple truth of it harry knew because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible once they vacated this spot for ron to find them again. he and hermione ate breakfast in silence. hermione ’s eyes were puffy and red she looked as if she had not slept. they packed up their things hermione dawdling. harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank several times he saw her look up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. every time harry imitated her looked around for he could not help hoping a little himself and saw nothing but rain-swept woods another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. he could hear ron saying “ we thought you knew what you were doing ”  and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach. the muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. they had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay she and harry grasped hands and disapparated reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside. the instant they arrived hermione dropped harry’s hand and walked away from him finally sitting down on a large rock her face on her knees shaking with what he knew were sobs. he watched her supposing that he ought to go and comfort her but something kept him rooted to the spot. everything inside him felt cold and tight again he saw the contemptuous expression on ron’s face. harry strode off through the heather walking in a large circle with the distraught hermione at its center casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection. they did not discuss ron at all over the next few days. harry was determined never to mention his name again and hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping he would hear her crying. meanwhile harry had started bringing out the marauder’s map and examining it by wandlight. he was waiting for the moment when ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of hogwarts proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle protected by his status of pureblood. however ron did not appear on the map and after a while harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep that she would somehow know he was thinking about her hoping that she was all right. by day they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of gryffindor’s sword but the more they talked about the places in which dumbledore might have hidden it the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. cudgel his brains though he might harry could not remember dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. there were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with ron or with dumbledore. we thought you knew what you were doing. . . . we thought dumbledore had told you what to do. . . . we thought you had a real plan he could not hide it from himself ron had been right. dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing. they had discovered one horcrux but they had no means of destroying it the others were as unattainable as they had ever been. hopelessness threatened to engulf him. he was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends’ offers to accompany him on this meandering pointless journey. he knew nothing he had no ideas and he was constantly painfully on the alert for any indication that hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough that she was leaving. they were spending many evenings in near silence and hermione took to bringing out phineas nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a chair as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by ron’s departure. despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again phineas nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what harry was up to and consented to reappear blindfolded every few days or so. harry was even glad to see him because he was company albeit of a snide and taunting kind. they relished any news about what was happening at hogwarts though phineas nigellus was not an ideal informer. he venerated snape the first slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about snape or phineas nigellus would instantly leave his painting. however he did let drop certain snippets. snape seemed to be facing a constant low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. ginny had been banned from going into hogsmeade. snape had reinstated umbridge’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies. from all of these things harry deduced that ginny and probably neville and luna along with her had been doing their best to continue dumbledore’s army. this scant news made harry want to see ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache but it also made him think of ron again and of dumbledore and of hogwarts itself which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. indeed as phineas nigellus talked about snape ’s crackdown harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of snape’s regime being fed and having a soft bed and other people being in charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment. but then he remembered that he was undesirable number one that there was a ten-thousand-galleon price on his head and that to walk into hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the ministry of magic. indeed phineas nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about harry and hermione’s whereabouts. hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this and phineas nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious good-byes. the weather grew colder and colder. they did not dare remain in any one area too long so rather than staying in the south of england where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries they continued to meander up and down the country braving a mountainside where sleet pounded the tent a wide flat marsh where the tent was flooded with chill water and a tiny island in the middle of a scottish loch where snow half buried the tent in the night. they had already spotted christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when harry resolved to suggest again what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. they had just eaten an unusually good meal hermione had been to a supermarket under the invisibility cloak scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left and harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti bolognese and tinned pears. he had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break from wearing the horcrux which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him. “hermione?” “hmm?” she was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with the tales of beedle the bard. he could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book which was not after all very long but evidently she was still deciphering something in it because spellman’s syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair. harry cleared his throat. he felt exactly as he had done on the occasion several years previously when he had asked professor mcgonagall whether he could go into hogsmeade despite the fact that he had not persuaded the dursleys to sign his permission slip. “hermione i’ve been thinking and — ” “harry could you help me with something?” apparently she had not been listening to him. she leaned forward and held out the tales of beedle the bard. “look at that symbol,” she said pointing to the top of a page. above what harry assumed was the title of the story being unable to read runes he could not be sure  there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye its pupil crossed with a vertical line. “i never took ancient runes hermione.” “i know that but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary either. all along i thought it was a picture of an eye but i don’t think it is! it’s been inked in look somebody’s drawn it there it isn’t really part of the book. think have you ever seen it before?” “no ... no wait a moment.” harry looked closer. “isn’t it the same symbol luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?” “well that’s what i thought too!” “then it’s grindelwald’s mark.” she stared at him openmouthed. “what?” “krum told me ...” he recounted the story that viktor krum had told him at the wedding. hermione looked astonished. “ grindelwald’s mark?” she looked from harry to the weird symbol and back again. “i’ve never heard that grindelwald had a mark. there’s no mention of it in anything i’ve ever read about him.” “well like i say krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at durmstrang and grindelwald put it there.” she fell back into the old armchair frowning. “that’s very odd. if it’s a symbol of dark magic what’s it doing in a book of children’s stories?” “yeah it is weird,” said harry. “and you’d think scrimgeour would have recognized it. he was minister he ought to have been expert on dark stuff.” “i know. ... perhaps he thought it was an eye just like i did. all the other stories have little pictures over the titles.” she did not speak but continued to pore over the strange mark. harry tried again. “hermione?” “hmm?” “i’ve been thinking. i — i want to go to godric’s hollow.” she looked up at him but her eyes were unfocused and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book. “yes,” she said. “yes i’ve been wondering that too. i really think we’ll have to.” “did you hear me right?” he asked. “of course i did. you want to go to godric’s hollow. i agree i think we should. i mean i can’t think of anywhere else it could be either. it’ll be dangerous but the more i think about it the more likely it seems it’s there.” “er — what’s there?” asked harry. at that she looked just as bewildered as he felt. “well the sword harry! dumbledore must have known you’d want to go back there and i mean godric’s hollow is godric gryffindor’s birthplace — ” “really gryffindor came from godric’s hollow?” “harry did you ever even open a history of magic?” “erm,” he said smiling for what felt like the first time in months the muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “i might’ve opened it you know when i bought it ... just the once. ...” “well as the village is named after him i’d have thought you might have made the connection,” said hermione. she sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library. “there’s a bit about the village in a history of magic wait ...” she opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook a history of magic by bathilda bagshot which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted. “ ‘upon the signature of the international statute of secrecy in 1689 wizards went into hiding for good. it was natural perhaps that they formed their own small communities within a community. many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families who banded together for mutual support and protection. the villages of tinworth in cornwall upper flagley in yorkshire and ottery st. catchpole on the south coast of england were notable homes to knots of wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes confunded muggles. most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is perhaps godric’s hollow the west country village where the great wizard godric gryffindor was born and where bowman wright wizarding smith forged the first golden snitch. the graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families and this accounts no doubt for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.’ “you and your parents aren’t mentioned,” hermione said closing the book “because professor bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. but you see godric’s hollow godric gryffindor gryffindor’s sword don’t you think dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection?” “oh yeah ...” harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to godric’s hollow. for him the lure of the village lay in his parents’ graves the house where he had narrowly escaped death and in the person of bathilda bagshot. “remember what muriel said?” he asked eventually. “who?” “you know,” he hesitated he did not want to say ron’s name. “ginny’s great-aunt. at the wedding. the one who said you had skinny ankles.” “oh,” said hermione. it was a sticky moment harry knew that she had sensed ron’s name in the offing. he rushed on “she said bathilda bagshot still lives in godric’s hollow.” “bathilda bagshot,” murmured hermione running her index finger over bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of a history of magic. “well i suppose she gasped so dramatically that harry’s insides turned over he drew his wand looking around at the entrance half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap but there was nothing there. “what?” he said half angry half relieved. “what did you do that for i thought you’d seen a death eater unzipping the tent at least — ” “harry what if bathilda’ s got the sword what if dumbledore entrusted it to her?” harry considered this possibility. bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now and according to muriel she was “gaga.” was it likely that dumbledore would have hidden the sword of gryffindor with her if so harry felt that dumbledore had left a great deal to chance dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with bathilda. now however was not the moment to cast doubt on hermione’s theory not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with harry’s dearest wish. “yeah he might have done! so are we going to go to godric’s hollow?” “yes but we’ll have to think it through carefully harry.” she was sitting up now and harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. “we’ll need to practice disapparating together under the invisibility cloak for a start and perhaps disillusionment charms would be sensible too unless you think we should go the whole hog and use polyjuice potion in that case we’ll need to collect hair from somebody. i actually think we’d better do that harry the thicker our disguises the better. ...” harry let her talk nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause but his mind had left the conversation. for the first time since he had discovered that the sword in gringotts was a fake he felt excited. he was about to go home about to return to the place where he had had a family. it was in godric’s hollow that but for voldemort he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. he could have invited friends to his house. ... he might even have had brothers and sisters. ... it would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. the life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. after hermione had gone to bed that night harry quietly extracted his rucksack from hermione ’s beaded bag and from inside it the photograph album hagrid had given him so long ago. for the first time in months he perused the old pictures of his parents smiling and waving up at him from the images which were all he had left of them now. harry would gladly have set out for godric’s hollow the following day but hermione had other ideas. convinced as she was that voldemort would expect harry to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. it was therefore a full week later — once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent muggles who were christmas shopping and had practiced apparating and disapparating while underneath the invisibility cloak together — that hermione agreed to make the journey. they were to apparate to the village under cover of darkness so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed polyjuice potion harry transforming into a balding middle-aged muggle man hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. the beaded bag containing all of their possessions apart from the horcrux which harry was wearing around his neck was tucked into an inside pocket of hermione ’s buttoned-up coat. harry lowered the invisibility cloak over them then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again. heart beating in his throat harry opened his eyes. they were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in which the night’s first stars were already glimmering feebly. cottages stood on either side of the narrow road christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. a short way ahead of them a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village. “all this snow!” hermione whispered beneath the cloak. “why didn’t we think of snow after all our precautions we’ll leave prints! we’ll just have to get rid of them — you go in front i’ll do it — ” harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces. “let’s take off the cloak,” said harry and when she looked frightened “oh come on we don’t look like us and there’s no one around.” he stowed the cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages any one of them might have been the one in which james and lily had once lived or where bathilda lived now. harry gazed at the front doors their snow-burdened roofs and their front porches wondering whether he remembered any of them knowing deep inside that it was impossible that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. he was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all he did not know what happened when the subjects of a fidelius charm died. then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village a small square was revealed to them. strung all around with colored lights there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle partly obscured by a windblown christmas tree. there were several shops a post office a pub and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel bright across the square. the snow here had become impacted it was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day. villagers were crisscrossing in front of them their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps. they heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed then they heard a carol start up inside the little church. “harry i think it’s christmas eve!” said hermione. “is it?” he had lost track of the date they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. “i’m sure it is,” said hermione her eyes upon the church. “they ... they’ll be in there won’t they your mum and dad i can see the graveyard behind it.” harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement more like fear. now that he was so near he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. perhaps hermione knew how he was feeling because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time pulling him forward. halfway across the square however she stopped dead. “harry look!” she was pointing at the war memorial. as they had passed it it had transformed. instead of an obelisk covered in names there was a statue of three people a man with untidy hair and glasses a woman with long hair and a kind pretty face and a baby boy sitting in his mother’s arms. snow lay upon all their heads like fluffy white caps. harry drew closer gazing up into his parents’ faces. he had never imagined that there would be a statue. . . . how strange it was to see himself represented in stone a happy baby without a scar on his forehead. “c’mon,” said harry when he had looked his fill and they turned again toward the church. as they crossed the road he glanced over his shoulder the statue had turned back into the war memorial. the singing grew louder as they approached the church. it made harry’s throat constrict it reminded him so forcefully of hogwarts of peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor of the great hall’s twelve christmas trees of dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker of ron in a hand-knitted sweater. . . . there was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. on either side of the slippery path to the church doors the snow lay deep and untouched. they moved off through the snow carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows. behind the church row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red gold and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow. keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket harry moved toward the nearest grave. “look at this it’s an abbott could be some long-lost relation of hannah’s!” “keep your voice down,” hermione begged him. they waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them stooping to peer at the words on old headstones every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied . “harry here!” hermione was two rows of tombstones away he had to wade back to her his heart positively banging in his chest. “is it — ” “no but look!” she pointed to the dark stone. harry stooped down and saw upon the frozen lichen-spotted granite the words kendra dumbledore and a short way below her dates of birth and death and her daughter ariana. there was also a quotation where your treasure is there will your heart be also. so rita skeeter and muriel had got some of their facts right. the dumbledore family had indeed lived here and part of it had died here. seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. harry could not help thinking that he and dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard and that dumbledore ought to have told him so yet he had never thought to share the connection. they could have visited the place together for a moment harry imagined coming here with dumbledore of what a bond that would have been of how much it would have meant to him. but it seemed that to dumbledore the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence irrelevant perhaps to the job he wanted harry to do. hermione was looking at harry and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. he read the words on the tombstone again. where your treasure is there will your heart be also. he did not understand what these words meant. surely dumbledore had chosen them as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died. “are you sure he never mentioned — ” hermione began. “no,” said harry curtly then “let’s keep looking,” and he turned away wishing he had not seen the stone he did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment. “here!” cried hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. “oh no sorry! i thought it said potter.” she was rubbing at a crumbling mossy stone gazing down at it a little frown on her face. “harry come back a moment.” he did not want to be sidetracked again and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her. “what?” “look at this!” the grave was extremely old weathered so that harry could hardly make out the name. hermione showed him the symbol beneath it. “harry that’s the mark in the book!” he peered at the place she indicated the stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name. “yeah ... it could be. ...” hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. “it says ig — ignotus i think. ...” “i’m going to keep looking for my parents all right?” harry told her a slight edge to his voice and he set off again leaving her crouched beside the old grave. every now and then he recognized a surname that like abbott he had met at hogwarts. sometimes there were several generations of the same wizarding family represented in the graveyard harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out or the current members had moved away from godric’s hollow. deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation. the darkness and the silence seemed to become all of a sudden much deeper. harry looked around worried thinking of dementors then realized that the carols had finished that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square. somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights. then hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third time sharp and clear from a few yards away. “harry they’re here ... right here.” and he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time he moved toward her feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest the same sensation he had had right after dumbledore had died a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs. the headstone was only two rows behind kendra and ariana’s. it was made of white marble just like dumbledore’s tomb and this made it easy to read as it seemed to shine in the dark. harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it. james potter born 27 march 1960 lily potter born 30 january 1960 died 31 october 1981 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. harry read the words slowly as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning and he read the last of them aloud. “ the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’...” a horrible thought came to him and with it a kind of panic. “isn’t that a death eater idea why is that there?” “it doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the death eaters mean it harry,” said hermione her voice gentle. “it means ... you know ... living beyond death. living after death.” but they were not living thought harry they were gone. the empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone indifferent unknowing. and tears came before he could stop them boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending he let them fall his lips pressed hard together looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of lily and james lay bones now surely or dust not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near his heart still beating alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing at this moment that he was sleeping under the snow with them. hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. he could not look at her but returned the pressure now taking deep sharp gulps of the night air trying to steady himself trying to regain control. he should have brought something to give them and he had not thought of it and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. but hermione raised her wand moved it in a circle through the air and a wreath of christmas roses blossomed before them. harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ grave. as soon as he stood up he wanted to leave he did not think he could stand another moment there. he put his arm around hermione’s shoulders and she put hers around his waist and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow past dumbledore’s mother and sister back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate. bathilda’s secret “harry stop.” “what’s wrong?” they had only just reached the grave of the unknown abbott. “there’s someone there. someone watching us. i can tell. there over by the bushes.” they stood quite still holding on to each other gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard. harry could not see anything. “are you sure?” “i saw something move i could have sworn i did. ...” she broke from him to free her wand arm. “we look like muggles,” harry pointed out. “muggles who ’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave! harry i’m sure there’s someone over there!” harry thought of a history of magic  the graveyard was supposed to be haunted what if —  but then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which hermione had pointed. ghosts could not move snow. “it’s a cat,” said harry after a second or two “or a bird. if it was a death eater we’d be dead by now. but let’s get out of here and we can put the cloak back on.” they glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. harry who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring hermione was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement. they pulled the invisibility cloak back over themselves. the pub was fuller than before many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church. for a moment harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it but before he could say anything hermione murmured “let’s go this way,” and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. they walked as quickly as they dared past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights the outlines of christmas trees dark through the curtains. “how are we going to find bathilda’s house?” asked hermione who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. “harry what do you think harry?” she tugged at his arm but harry was not paying attention. he was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. next moment he had sped up dragging hermione along with him she slipped a little on the ice. “harry — ” “look. ... look at it hermione. ...” “i don’t ... oh!” he could see it the fidelius charm must have died with james and lily. the hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since hagrid had taken harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. most of the cottage was still standing though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart that harry was sure was where the curse had backfired. he and hermione stood at the gate gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it. “i wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered hermione. “maybe you can’t rebuild it?” harry replied. “maybe it’s like the injuries from dark magic and you can’t repair the damage?” he slipped a hand from beneath the cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate not wishing to open it but simply to hold some part of the house. “you’re not going to go inside it looks unsafe it might — oh harry look!” his touch on the gate seemed to have done it. a sign had risen out of the ground in front of them up through the tangles of nettles and weeds like some bizarre fast-growing flower and in golden letters upon the wood it said on this spot on the night of 31 october 1 981 lily and james potter lost their lives. their son harry remains the only wizard ever to have survived the killing curse. this house invisible to muggles has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family. and all around these neatly lettered words scribbles had been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the boy who lived had escaped. some had merely signed their names in everlasting ink others had carved their initials into the wood still others had left messages. the most recent of these shining brightly over sixteen years’ worth of magical graffiti all said similar things. good luck harry wherever you are. if you read this harry we’re all behind you! long live harry potter. “they shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said hermione indignant. but harry beamed at her. “it’s brilliant. i’m glad they did. i ...” he broke off. a heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square. harry thought though it was hard to judge that the figure was a woman. she was moving slowly possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. her stoop her stoutness her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. they watched in silence as she drew nearer. harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing but he knew instinctively that she would not. at last she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road facing them. he did not need hermione’s pinch to his arm. there was next to no chance that this woman was a muggle she was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her if she was not a witch. even assuming that she was a witch however it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold simply to look at an old ruin. by all the rules of normal magic meanwhile she ought not to be able to see hermione and him at all. nevertheless harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there and also who they were. just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion she raised a gloved hand and beckoned. hermione moved closer to him under the cloak her arm pressed against his. “how does she know?” he shook his head. the woman beckoned again more vigorously. harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street. was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months that dumbledore had told her to wait and that harry would come in the end was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot even her ability to sense them suggested some dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered before. finally harry spoke causing hermione to gasp and jump. “are you bathilda?” the muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. beneath the cloak harry and hermione looked at each other. harry raised his eyebrows hermione gave a tiny nervous nod. they stepped toward the woman and at once she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come. leading them past several houses she turned in at a gate. they followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. she fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door then opened it and stepped back to let them pass. she smelled bad or perhaps it was her house harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the cloak. now that he was beside her he realized how tiny she was bowed down with age she came barely level with his chest. she closed the door behind them her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint then turned and peered into harry’s face. her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. he wondered whether she could make him out at all even if she could it was the balding muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see. the odor of old age of dust of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly. “bathilda?” harry repeated. she nodded again. harry became aware of the locket against his skin the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. did it know could it sense that the thing that would destroy it was near bathilda shuffled past them pushing hermione aside as though she had not seen her and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room. “harry i’m not sure about this,” breathed hermione. “look at the size of her i think we could overpower her if we had to,” said harry. “listen i should have told you i knew she wasn’t all there. muriel called her ‘gaga.’ ” “come!” called bathilda from the next room. hermione jumped and clutched harry’s arm. “it’s okay,” said harry reassuringly and he led the way into the sitting room. bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles but it was still very dark not to mention extremely dirty. thick dust crunched beneath their feet and harry’s nose detected underneath the dank and mildewed smell something worse like meat gone bad. he wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside bathilda’s house to check whether she was coping. she seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic too for she lit the candles clumsily by hand her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire. “let me do that,” offered harry and he took the matches from her. she stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups. the last surface on which harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. when the flame danced into life its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. he saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. as bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire he muttered “ tergeo ” the dust vanished from the photographs and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames. he wondered whether bathilda or somebody else had removed them. then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye and he snatched it up. it was the golden-haired merry-faced thief the young man who had perched on gregorovitch’s windowsill smiling lazily up at harry out of the silver frame. and it came to harry instantly where he had seen the boy before in the life and lies of albus dumbledore arm in arm with the teenage dumbledore and that must be where all the missing photographs were in rita’s book. “mrs. — miss — bagshot?” he said and his voice shook slightly. “who is this?” bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching hermione light the fire for her. “miss bagshot?” harry repeated and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. bathilda looked up at his voice and the horcrux beat faster upon his chest. “who is this person?” harry asked her pushing the picture forward. she peered at it solemnly then up at harry. “do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. “this man do you know him what’s he called?” bathilda merely looked vague. harry felt an awful frustration. how had rita skeeter unlocked bathilda’s memories “who is this man?” he repeated loudly. “harry what are you doing?” asked hermione. “this picture hermione it’s the thief the thief who stole from gregorovitch! please!” he said to bathilda. “who is this?” but she only stared at him. “why did you ask us to come with you mrs. — miss — bagshot?” asked hermione raising her own voice. “was there something you wanted to tell us?” giving no sign that she had heard hermione bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to harry. with a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. “you want us to leave?” he asked. she repeated the gesture this time pointing firstly at him then at herself then at the ceiling. “oh right ... hermione i think she wants me to go upstairs with her.” “all right,” said hermione “let’s go.” but when hermione moved bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor once more pointing first at harry then to herself. “she wants me to go with her alone.” “why?” asked hermione and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise. “maybe dumbledore told her to give the sword to me and only to me?” “do you really think she knows who you are?” “yes,” said harry looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own “i think she does.” “well okay then but be quick harry.” “lead the way,” harry told bathilda. she seemed to understand because she shuffled around him toward the door. harry glanced back at hermione with a reassuring smile but he was not sure she had seen it she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor looking toward the bookcase. as harry walked out of the room unseen by both hermione and bathilda he slipped the silver framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket. the stairs were steep and narrow harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him which seemed only too likely. slowly wheezing a little she climbed to the upper landing turned immediately right and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom. it was pitch-black and smelled horrible harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness. “lumos,” said harry and his wand ignited. he gave a start bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness and he had not heard her approach. “you are potter?” she whispered. “yes i am.” she nodded slowly solemnly. harry felt the horcrux beating fast faster than his own heart it was an unpleasant agitating sensation. “have you got anything for me?” harry asked but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip. “have you got anything for me?” he repeated. then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once harry’s scar prickled painfully the horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved the dark fetid room dissolved momentarily. he felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high cold voice hold him). harry swayed where he stood the dark foul-smelling room seemed to close around him again he did not know what had just happened. “have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time much louder. “over here,” she whispered pointing to the corner. harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. this time she did not lead him. harry edged between her and the unmade bed his wand raised. he did not want to look away from her. “what is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry. “there,” she said pointing at the shapeless mass. and in the instant that he looked away his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt a ruby she moved weirdly he saw it out of the corner of his eye panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been. the snake struck as he raised his wand the force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him he fell backward onto the dressing table into the mound of filthy clothing — he rolled sideways narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor. from below he heard hermione call “harry?” he could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him powerful muscular “no!” he gasped pinned to the floor. “yes,” whispered the voice. “yesss ... hold you ... hold you ...” “accio ... accio wand ...” but nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso squeezing the air from him pressing the horcrux hard into his chest a circle of ice that throbbed with life inches from his own frantic heart and his brain was flooding with cold white light all thought obliterated his own breath drowned distant footsteps everything going. ... a metal heart was banging outside his chest and now he was flying flying with triumph in his heart without need of broomstick or thestral. ... he was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness nagini had released him. he scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light it struck and hermione dived aside with a shriek her deflected curse hit the curtained window which shattered. frozen air filled the room as harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand — he bent and snatched it up but now the room was full of the snake its tail thrashing hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment harry thought the worst but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light and the snake flew into the air smacking harry hard in the face as it went coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. harry raised his wand but as he did so his scar seared more painfully more powerfully than it had done in years. “he’s coming! hermione he’s comingl” as he yelled the snake fell hissing wildly. everything was chaos it smashed shelves from the wall and splintered china flew everywhere as harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be hermione — she shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed the snake reared again but harry knew that worse than the snake was coming was perhaps already at the gate his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar — the snake lunged as he took a running leap dragging hermione with him as it struck hermione screamed “ confringov’ and her spell flew around the room exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them bouncing from floor to ceiling harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. glass cut his cheek as pulling hermione with him he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair. ... and then his scar burst open and he was voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish and he screamed with rage a scream that mingled with the girl’s that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in christmas day. ... and his scream was harry’s scream his pain was harry’s pain ... that it could happen here where it had happened before ... here within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die ... to die. ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his body. ... but if he had no body why did his head hurt so badly if he was dead how could he feel so unbearably didn’t pain cease with death didn’t it go ... the night wet and windy two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the shop windows covered in paper spiders all the tawdry muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe. ... and he was gliding along that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions. . . . not anger . . . that was for weaker souls than he ... but triumph yes. ... he had waited for this he had hoped for it. ... “nice costume mister!” he saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak saw the fear cloud his painted face then the child turned and ran away. ... beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand. ... one simple movement and the child would never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary quite unnecessary. . . . and along a new and darker street he moved and now his destination was in sight at last the fidelius charm broken though they did not know it yet. ... and he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge and stared over it. ... they had not drawn the curtains he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room the tall black-haired man in his glasses making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. the child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke to grab it in his small fist. ... a door opened and the mother entered saying words he could not hear her long dark-red hair falling over her face. now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. he threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched yawning. . . . the gate creaked a little as he pushed it open but james potter did not hear. his white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door which burst open. he was over the threshold as james came sprinting into the hall. it was easy too easy he had not even picked up his wand. ... “lily take harry and go! it’s him! go! run! ill hold him off!” hold him off without a wand in his hand! . . . he laughed before casting the curse. . . . “avada kedavra!” the green light filled the cramped hallway it lit the pram pushed against the wall it made the banisters glare like lightning rods and james potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut. ... he could hear her screaming from the upper floor trapped but as long as she was sensible she at least had nothing to fear. ... he climbed the steps listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in. ... she had no wand upon her either. ... how stupid they were and how trusting thinking that their safety lay in friends that weapons could be discarded even for moments. ... he forced the door open cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand ... and there she stood the child in her arms. at the sight of him she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide as if this would help as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead. . . . “not harry not harry please not harry!” “stand aside you silly girl . . . stand aside now. ” “not harry please no take me kill me instead — ” “this is my last warning — ” “not harry! please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . . not harry! not harry! please — i’ll do anything — ” “stand aside. stand aside girl!” he could have forced her away from the crib but it seemed more prudent to finish them all. ... the green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. the child had not cried all this time he could stand clutching the bars of his crib and he looked up into the intruder’s face with a kind of bright interest perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak making more pretty lights and his mother would pop up any moment laughing — he pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face he wanted to see it happen the destruction of this one inexplicable danger. the child began to cry it had seen that he was not james. he did not like it crying he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage — “avada kedavra!” and then he broke he was nothing nothing but pain and terror and he must hide himself not here in the rubble of the ruined house where the child was trapped and screaming but far away . . . far away. . . . “no,” he moaned. the snake rustled on the filthy cluttered floor and he had killed the boy and yet he was the boy. . . . “no ...” and now he stood at the broken window of bathilda’s house immersed in memories of his greatest loss and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass. ... he looked down and saw something ... something incredible. . . . “no ...” “harry it’s all right you’re all right!” he stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. there he was the unknown thief the thief he was seeking. . . . “no ... i dropped it. ... i dropped it. ...” “harry it’s okay wake up wake up!” he was harry. ... harry not voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake. ... he opened his eyes. “harry,” hermione whispered. “do you feel all — all right?” “yes,” he lied. he was in the tent lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. he could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the quality of the cold flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. he was drenched in sweat he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. “we got away.” “yes,” said hermione. “i had to use a hover charm to get you into your bunk i couldn’t lift you. you’ve been ... well you haven’t been quite ...” there were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand she had been wiping his face. “you’ve been ill,” she finished. “quite ill.” “how long ago did we leave?” “hours ago. it’s nearly morning.” “and i’ve been ... what unconscious?” “not exactly,” said hermione uncomfortably. “you’ve been shouting and moaning and ... things,” she added in a tone that made harry feel uneasy. what had he done screamed curses like voldemort cried like the baby in the crib “i couldn’t get the horcrux off you,” hermione said and he knew she wanted to change the subject. “it was stuck stuck to your chest. you’ve got a mark i’m sorry i had to use a severing charm to get it away. the snake bit you too but i’ve cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it. ...” he pulled the sweaty t-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. there was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. he could also see the half-healed puncture marks to his forearm. “where ve you put the horcrux?” “in my bag. i think we should keep it off for a while.” he lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face. “we shouldn’t have gone to godric’s hollow. it’s my fault it’s all my fault hermione i’m sorry.” “it’s not your fault. i wanted to go too i really thought dumbledore might have left the sword there for you.” “yeah well ... we got that wrong didn’t we?” “what happened harry what happened when she took you upstairs was the snake hiding somewhere did it just come out and kill her and attack you?” “no,” he said. “she was the snake ... or the snake was her ... all along.” “w-what?” he closed his eyes. he could still smell bathilda’s house on him it made the whole thing horribly vivid. “bathilda must’ve been dead a while. the snake was ... was inside her. you-know-who put it there in godric’s hollow to wait. you were right. he knew i’d go back.” “the snake was inside her?” he opened his eyes again hermione looked revolted nauseated. “lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” harry said. “she didn’t want to talk in front of you because it was parseltongue all parseltongue and i didn’t realize but of course i could understand her. once we were up in the room the snake sent a message to you-know-who i heard it happen inside my head i felt him get excited he said to keep me there ... and then ...” he remembered the snake coming our of bathilda’s neck hermione did not need to know the details. ... she changed changed into the snake and attacked.” he looked down at the puncture marks. “it wasn’t supposed to kill me just keep me there till you-know-who came.” if he had only managed to kill the snake it would have been worth it all of it. ... sick at heart he sat up and threw back the covers. “harry no i’m sure you ought to rest!” “you’re the one who needs sleep. no offense but you look terrible. i’m fine. i’ll keep watch for a while. where’s my wand?” she did not answer she merely looked at him. “where’s my wand hermione?” she was biting her lip and tears swam in her eyes. “harry ...” “ where’s my wand?” she reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. the holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. one fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. the wood had splintered apart completely. harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. he could not think properly everything was a blur of panic and fear. then he held out the wand to hermione. “mend it. please.” “harry i don’t think when it’s broken like this — ” “please hermione try!” “r-reparo.” the dangling half of the wand resealed itself. harry held it up. “lumosl” the wand sparked feebly then went out. harry pointed it at hermione. “ expelliarmusl” hermione ’s wand gave a little jerk but did not leave her hand. the feeble attempt at magic was too much for harry’s wand which split into two again. he stared at it aghast unable to take in what he was seeing . . . the wand that had survived so much . . . “harry,” hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. “i’m so so sorry. i think it was me. as we were leaving you know the snake was coming for us and so i cast a blasting curse and it rebounded everywhere and it must have — must have hit — ” “it was an accident,” said harry mechanically. he felt empty stunned. “we’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it.” “harry i don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said hermione the tears trickling down her face. “remember . . . remember ron when he broke his wand crashing the car it was never the same again he had to get a new one.” harry thought of ollivander kidnapped and held hostage by voldemort of gregorovitch who was dead. how was he supposed to find himself a new wand “well,” he said in a falsely matter-of-fact voice “well i’ll just borrow yours for now then. while i keep watch.” her face glazed with tears hermione handed over her wand and he left her sitting beside his bed desiring nothing more than to get away from her. the life and lies of albus dumbledore the sun was coming up the pure colorless vastness of the sky stretched over him indifferent to him and his suffering. harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean air. simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth yet he could not appreciate it his senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand. he looked out over a valley blanketed in snow distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence. without realizing it he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. he had spilled his own blood more times than he could count he had lost all the bones in his right arm once this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead but never until this moment had he felt himself to be fatally weakened vulnerable and naked as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from him. he knew exactly what hermione would say if he expressed any of this the wand is only as good as the wizard. but she was wrong his case was different. she had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. he had lost the protection of the twin cores and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting upon it. he pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and without looking at them tucked them away in hagrid’s pouch around his neck. the pouch was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more. harry’s hand brushed the old snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. impenetrable unhelpful useless like everything else dumbledore had left behind — and his fury at dumbledore broke over him now like lava scorching him inside wiping out every other feeling. out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that godric’s hollow held answers convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by dumbledore but there was no map no plan. dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors alone and unaided nothing was explained nothing was given freely they had no sword and now harry had no wand. and he had dropped the photograph of the thief and it would surely be easy now for voldemort to find out who he was. ... voldemort had all the information now. ... “harry?” hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. her face streaked with tears she crouched down beside him two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm. “thanks,” he said taking one of the cups. “do you mind if i talk to you?” “no,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. “harry you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. well ... i’ve got the book.” timidly she pushed it onto his lap a pristine copy of the life and lies of albus dumbledore. “where — how — ” “it was in bathilda’s sitting room just lying there. ... this note was sticking out of the top of it.” hermione read the few lines of spiky acid-green writing aloud. “ ‘dear batty thanks for your help. here’s a copy of the book hope you like it. you said everything even if you don’t remember it. rita.’ i think it must have arrived while the real bathilda was alive but perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?” “no she probably wasn’t.” harry looked down upon dumbledore ’s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure now he would know all the things that dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him whether dumbledore wanted him to or not. “you’re still really angry at me aren’t you?” said hermione he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. “no,” he said quietly. “no hermione i know it was an accident. you were trying to get us out of there alive and you were incredible. i’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me.” he tried to return her watery smile then turned his attention to the book. its spine was stiff it had clearly never been opened before. he riffled through the pages looking for photographs. he came across the one he sought almost at once the young dumbledore and his handsome companion roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. harry dropped his eyes to the caption. albus dumbledore shortly after his mother’s death with his friend gellert grindelwald. harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. grindelwald. his friend grindelwald. he looked sideways at hermione who was still contemplating the name as though she could not believe her eyes. slowly she looked up at harry. “ grindelwald?” ignoring the remainder of the photographs harry searched the pages around them for a recurrence of that fatal name. he soon discovered it and read greedily but became lost it was necessary to go further back to make sense of it all and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled “the greater good.” together he and hermione started to read now approaching his eighteenth birthday dumbledore left hogwarts in a blaze of glory — head boy prefect winner of the barnabus finkley prize for exceptional spell-casting british youth representative to the wizengamot gold medal winner for ground-breaking contribution to the international alchemical conference in cairo. dumbledore intended next to take a grand tour with elphias “dogbreath” doge the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school. the two young men were staying at the leaky cauldron in london preparing to depart for greece the following morning when an owl arrived bearing news of dumbledore’ s mother’s death. “dogbreath” doge who refused to be interviewed for this book has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. he represents kendra’s death as a tragic blow and dumbledore’s decision to give up his expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. certainly dumbledore returned to godric’s hollow at once supposedly to “care” for his younger brother and sister. but how much care did he actually give them “he were a head case that aberforth,” says enid smeek whose family lived on the outskirts of godric’s hollow at that time. “ran wild. ’course with his mum and dad gone you’d have felt sorry for him only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. i don’t think albus was fussed about him i never saw them together anyway.” so what was albus doing if not comforting his wild young brother the answer it seems is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. for though her first jailer had died there was no change in the pitiful condition of ariana dumbledore. her very existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who like “dogbreath” doge could be counted upon to believe in the story of her “ill health.” another such easily satisfied friend of the family was bathilda bagshot the celebrated magical historian who has lived in godric’s hollow for many years. kendra of course had rebuffed bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. several years later however the author sent an owl to albus at hog warts having been favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in transfiguration today. this initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire dumbledore family . at the time of kendra’s death bathilda was the only person in godric’s hollow who was on speaking terms with dumbledore’s mother. unfortunately the brilliance that bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. “the fire’s lit but the cauldron’s empty,” as ivor dillonsby put it to me or in enid smeek’s slightly earthier phrase “she’s nutty as squirrel poo.” nevertheless a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story. like the rest of the wizarding world bathilda puts kendra’s premature death down to a backfiring charm a story repeated by albus and aberforth in later years. bathilda also parrots the family line on ariana calling her “frail” and “delicate.” on one subject however bathilda is well worth the effort i put into procuring veritaserum for she and she alone knows the full story of the best-kept secret of albus dumbledore’s life. now revealed for the first time it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of dumbledore his supposed hatred of the dark arts his opposition to the oppression of muggles even his devotion to his own family. the very same summer that dumbledore went home to godric’s hollow now an orphan and head of the family bathilda bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew gellert grindelwald. the name of grindelwald is justly famous in a list of most dangerous dark wizards of all time he would miss out on the top spot only because you-know-who arrived a generation later to steal his crown. as grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to britain however the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. educated at durmstrang a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the dark arts grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as dumbledore. rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes however gellert grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. at sixteen years old even durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of gellert grindelwald and he was expelled. hitherto all that has been known of grindelwald ’s next movements is that he “traveled abroad for some months.” it can now be revealed that grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in godric’s hollow and that there intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it he struck up a close friendship with none other than albus dumbledore. “he seemed a charming boy to me,” babbles bathilda “whatever he became later. naturally i introduced him to poor albus who was missing the company of lads his own age. the boys took to each other at once.” they certainly did. bathilda shows me a letter kept by her that albus dumbledore sent gellert grindelwald in the dead of night. “yes even after they’d spent all day in discussion — both such brilliant young boys they got on like a cauldron on fire — i’d sometimes hear an owl tapping at gellert’s bedroom window delivering a letter from albus! an idea would have struck him and he had to let gellert know immediately!” and what ideas they were. profoundly shocking though albus dumbledore’ s fans will find it here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero as relayed to his new best friend. a copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463. gellert — your point about wizard dominance being for the muggles’ own good — this i think  is the crucial point. yes we have been given power and yes that power gives us the right to rule but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. we must stress this point it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. where we are opposed as we surely will be this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. we seize control for the greater good. and from this it follows that where we meet resistance we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. this was your mistake at durmstrang! but i do not complain because if you had not been expelled we would never have met. albus astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be this letter constitutes proof that albus dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the statute of secrecy and establishing wizard rule over muggles. what a blow for those who have always portrayed dumbledore as the muggle-boms’ greatest champion! how hollow those speeches promoting muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! how despicable does albus dumbledore appear busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister! no doubt those determined to keep dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not after all put his plans into action that he must have suffered a change of heart that he came to his senses. however the truth seems altogether more shocking. barely two months into their great new friendship dumbledore and grindelwald parted never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel for more see chapter 22). what caused this abrupt rupture had dumbledore come to his senses had he told grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans alas no. “it was poor little ariana dying i think that did it,” says bathilda. “it came as an awful shock. gellert was there in the house when it happened and he came back to my house all of a dither told me he wanted to go home the next day. terribly distressed you know. so i arranged a portkey and that was the last i saw of him. “albus was beside himself at ariana’s death. it was so dreadful for those two brothers. they had lost everybody except each other. no wonder tempers ran a little high. aberforth blamed albus you know as people will under these dreadful circumstances. but aberforth always talked a little madly poor boy. all the same breaking albus’s nose at the funeral was not decent. it would have destroyed kendra to see her sons fighting like that across her daughter’s body. a shame gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. ... he would have been a comfort to albus at least. this dreadful coffin side brawl known only to those few who attended ariana dumbledore’s funeral raises several questions. why exactly did aberforth dumbledore blame albus for his sister’s death was it as “batty” pretends a mere effusion of grief or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury grindelwald expelled from durmstrang for near-fatal attacks upon fellow students fled the country hours after the girl’s death and albus out of shame or fear never saw him again not until forced to do so by the pleas of the wizarding world. neither dumbledore nor grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. however there can be no doubt that dumbledore delayed for some five years of turmoil fatalities and disappearances his attack upon gellert grindelwald. was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused dumbledore to hesitate was it only reluctantly that dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met and how did the mysterious ariana die was she the inadvertent victim of some dark rite did she stumble across something she ought not to have done as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination is it possible that ariana dumbledore was the first person to die “for the greater good” the chapter ended here and harry looked up. hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him. she tugged the book out of harry’s hands looking a little alarmed by his expression and closed it without looking at it as though hiding something indecent. “harry — ” but he shook his head. some inner certainty had crashed down inside him it was exactly as he had felt after ron left. he had trusted dumbledore believed him the embodiment of goodness and wisdom. all was ashes how much more could he lose ron dumbledore the phoenix wand ... “harry.” she seemed to have heard his thoughts. “listen to me. it — it doesn’t make very nice reading “yeah you could say that — ” “ — but don’t forget harry this is rita skeeter writing.” “you did read that letter to grindelwald didn’t you?” “yes i — i did.” she hesitated looking upset cradling her tea in her cold hands. “i think that’s the worst bit. i know bathilda thought it was all just talk but ‘for the greater good’ became grindelwald ’s slogan his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. and . . . from that ... it looks like dumbledore gave him the idea. they say ‘for the greater good’ was even carved over the entrance to nurmengard.” “what’s nurmengard?” “the prison grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. he ended up in there himself once dumbledore had caught him. anyway it’s — it’s an awful thought that dumbledore ’s ideas helped grindelwald rise to power. but on the other hand even rita can’t pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young and — ” “i thought you’d say that,” said harry. he did not want to let his anger spill out at her but it was hard to keep his voice steady. “i thought you’d say they were young. ’ they were the same age as we are now. and here we are risking our lives to fight the dark arts and there he was in a huddle with his new best friend plotting their rise to power over the muggles.” his temper would not remain in check much longer he stood up and walked around trying to work some of it off. “i’m not trying to defend what dumbledore wrote,” said hermione. “all that ‘right to rule’ rubbish it’s ‘magic is might’ all over again. but harry his mother had just died he was stuck alone in the house — ” “alone he wasn’t alone! he had his brother and sister for company his squib sister he was keeping locked up — ” “i don’t believe it,” said hermione. she stood up too. “whatever was wrong with that girl i don’t think she was a squib. the dumbledore we knew would never ever have allowed — ” “the dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer muggles by force!” harry shouted his voice echoing across the empty hilltop and several blackbirds rose into the air squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. “he changed harry he changed! it’s as simple as that! maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the dark arts! dumbledore was the one who stopped grindelwald the one who always voted for muggle protection and muggle-born rights who fought you-know-who from the start and who died trying to bring him down!” rita’s book lay on the ground between them so that the face of albus dumbledore smiled dolefully at both. “harry i’m sorry but i think the real reason you’re so angry is that dumbledore never told you any of this himself.” “maybe i am!” harry bellowed and he flung his arms over his head hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. “look what he asked from me hermione! risk your life harry! and again! and again! and don’t expect me to explain everything just trust me blindly trust that i know what i’m doing trust me even though i don’t trust you! never the whole truth! never!” his voice cracked with the strain and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and the emptiness and harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky. “he loved you,” hermione whispered. “i know he loved you.” harry dropped his arms. “i don’t know who he loved hermione but it was never me. this isn’t love the mess he’s left me in. he shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with gellert grindelwald than he ever shared with me.” harry picked up hermione ’s wand which he had dropped in the snow and sat back down in the entrance of the tent. “thanks for the tea. i’ll finish the watch. you get back in the warm.” she hesitated but recognized the dismissal. she picked up the book and then walked back past him into the tent but as she did so she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. he closed his eyes at her touch and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true that dumbledore had really cared. the silver doe it was snowing by the time hermione took over the watch at midnight. harry’s dreams were confused and disturbing nagini wove in and out of them first through a gigantic cracked ring then through a wreath of christmas roses. he woke repeatedly panicky convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices. finally he got up in the darkness and joined hermione who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading a history of magic by the light of her wand. the snow was still falling thickly and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on. “well go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. “i kept thinking i could hear people moving outside. i even thought i saw somebody once or twice.” harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent motionless sneakoscope on the table. “i’m sure i imagined it,” said hermione looking nervous. “the snow in the dark it plays tricks on your eyes. ... but perhaps we ought to disapparate under the invisibility cloak just in case?” half an hour later with the tent packed harry wearing the horcrux and hermione clutching the beaded bag they disapparated. the usual tightness engulfed them harry’s feet parted company with the snowy ground then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves. “where are we?” he asked peering around at a fresh mass of trees as hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles. “the forest of dean,” she said. “i came camping here once with my mum and dad.” here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold but they were at least protected from the wind. they spent most of the day inside the tent huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that hermione was so adept at producing and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness an impression reinforced by hermione ’s solicitousness. that afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow. after two nights of little sleep harry’s senses seemed more alert than usual. their escape from godric’s hollow had been so narrow that voldemort seemed somehow closer than before more threatening. as darkness drew in again harry refused hermione’s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed. harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so still shivery. the darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. he was on the point of taking out the marauder’s map so as to watch ginny’s dot for a while before he remembered that it was the christmas holidays and that she would be back at the burrow. every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. harry knew that it must be full of living creatures but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other sinister movements. he remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. their protective enchantments had worked for weeks why should they break now and yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight. several times he jerked upright his neck aching because he had fallen asleep slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. the night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between disapparition and apparition. he had just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened. a bright silver light appeared right ahead of him moving through the trees. whatever the source it was moving soundlessly. the light seemed simply to drift toward him. he jumped to his feet his voice frozen in his throat and raised hermione’s wand. he screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette and still the thing came closer. ... and then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. it was a silver white doe moon-bright and dazzling picking her way over the ground still silent and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. she stepped toward him her beautiful head with its wide long-lashed eyes held high. harry stared at the creature filled with wonder not at her strangeness but at her inexplicable familiarity. he felt that he had been waiting for her to come but that he had forgotten until this moment that they had arranged to meet. his impulse to shout for hermione which had been so strong a moment ago had gone. he knew he would have staked his life on it that she had come for him and him alone. they gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away. “no,” he said and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “come back!” she continued to step deliberately through the trees and soon her brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. for one trembling second he hesitated. caution murmured it could be a trick a lure a trap. but instinct overwhelming instinct told him that this was not dark magic. he set off in pursuit. snow crunched beneath his feet but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees for she was nothing but light. deeper and deeper into the forest she led him and harry walked quickly sure that when she stopped she would allow him to approach her properly. and then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know. at last she came to a halt. she turned her beautiful head toward him once more and he broke into a run a question burning in him but as he opened his lips to ask it she vanished. though the darkness had swallowed her whole her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas it obscured his vision brightening when he lowered his eyelids disorienting him. now fear came her presence had meant safety. “lumos\” he whispered and the wand-tip ignited. the imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there listening to the sounds of the forest to distant crackles of twigs soft swishes of snow. was he about to be attacked had she enticed him into an ambush was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight watching him he held the wand higher. nobody ran out at him no flash of green light burst from behind a tree. why then had she led him to this spot something gleamed in the light of the wand and harry spun about but all that was there was a small frozen pool its cracked black surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it. he moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. the ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight but deep below the thick misty gray carapace something else glinted. a great silver cross his heart skipped into his mouth he dropped to his knees at the pool’s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. a glint of deep red ... it was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. ... the sword of gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool. barely breathing he stared down at it. how was this possible how could it have come to be lying in a forest pool this close to the place where they were camping had some unknown magic drawn hermione to this spot or was the doe which he had taken to be a patronus some kind of guardian of the pool or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived precisely because they were here in which case where was the person who had wanted to pass it to harry again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes searching for a human outline for the glint of an eye but he could not see anyone there. all the same a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool. he pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured “accio sword.” it did not stir. he had not expected it to. if it had been that easy the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up not in the depths of a frozen pool. he set off around the circle of ice thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. he had been in terrible danger then and had asked for help. “help,” he murmured but the sword remained upon the pool bottom indifferent motionless. what was it harry asked himself walking again that dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword only a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. and what were the qualities that defined a gryffindor a small voice inside harry’s head answered him their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart. harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. he knew what he had to do. if he was honest with himself he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice. he glanced around at the surrounding trees again but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him. they had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. the only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. with fumbling fingers harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. where “chivalry” entered into this he thought ruefully he was not entirely sure unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for hermione to do it in his stead. an owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off and he thought with a pang of hedwig. he was shivering now his teeth chattering horribly and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear barefooted in the snow. he placed the pouch containing his wand his mother’s letter the shard of sirius’s mirror and the old snitch on top of his clothes then he pointed hermione’s wand at the ice. “diffindo.” it cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence the surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. as far as harry could judge it was not deep but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely. contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. he stepped to the pool’s edge and placed hermione’s wand on the ground still lit. then trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering he jumped. every pore of his body screamed in protest the very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. he could hardly breathe trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool he felt for the blade with his numb feet. he only wanted to dive once. harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second gasping and shaking until he told himself that it must be done gathered all his courage and dived. the cold was agony it attacked him like fire. his brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out groping for the sword. his fingers closed around the hilt he pulled it upward. then something closed tight around his neck. he thought of water weeds though nothing had brushed him as he dived and raised his empty hand to free himself. it was not weed the chain of the horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe. harry kicked out wildly trying to push himself back to the surface but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. thrashing suffocating he scrabbled at the strangling chain his frozen fingers unable to loosen it and now little lights were popping inside his head and he was going to drown there was nothing left nothing he could do and the arms that closed around his chest were surely death’s. ... choking and retching soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life he came to facedown in the snow. somewhere close by another person was panting and coughing and staggering around. hermione had come again as she had come when the snake attacked. ... yet it did not sound like her not with those deep coughs not judging by the weight of the footsteps. ... harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity. all he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. it was gone someone had cut him free. then a panting voice spoke from over his head. “are — you — mental?” nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given harry the strength to get up. shivering violently he staggered to his feet. there before him stood ron fully dressed but drenched to the skin his hair plastered to his face the sword of gryffindor in one hand and the horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other. “why the hell,” panted ron holding up the horcrux which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?” harry could not answer. the silver doe was nothing nothing compared with ron’s reappearance he could not believe it. shuddering with cold he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water’s edge and began to pull them on. as he dragged sweater after sweater over his head harry stared at ron half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him and yet he had to be real he had just dived into the pool he had saved harry’s life. “it was y-you?” harry said at last his teeth chattering his voice weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation. “well yeah,” said ron looking slightly confused. “y-you cast that doe?” “what no of course not! i thought it was you doing it!” “my patronus is a stag.” “oh yeah. i thought it looked different. no antlers.” harry put hagrid’s pouch back around his neck pulled on a final sweater stooped to pick up hermione’s wand and faced ron again. “how come you’re here?” apparently ron had hoped that this point would come up later if at all. “well i’ve — you know — i’ve come back. if — ” he cleared his throat. “you know. you still want me.” there was a pause in which the subject of ron’s departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. yet he was here. he had returned. he had just saved harry’s life. ron looked down at his hands. he seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding. “oh yeah i got it out,” he said rather unnecessarily holding up the sword for harry’s inspection. “that’s why you jumped in right?” “yeah,” said harry. “but i don’t understand. how did you get here how did you find us?” “long story,” said ron. “i’ve been looking for you for hours it’s a big forest isn’t it and i was just thinking i’d have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when i saw that deer coming and you following.” “you didn’t see anyone else?” “no,” said ron. “i — ” but he hesitated glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away. “i did think i saw something move over there but i was running to the pool at the time because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up so i wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey!” harry was already hurrying to the place ron had indicated. the two oaks grew close together there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level an ideal place to see but not be seen. the ground around the roots however was free of snow and harry could see no sign of footprints. he walked back to where ron stood waiting still holding the sword and the horcrux. “anything there?” ron asked. “no,” said harry. “so how did the sword get in that pool?” “whoever cast the patronus must have put it there.” they both looked at the ornate silver sword its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from hermione’s wand. “you reckon this is the real one?” asked ron. “one way to find out isn’t there?” said harry. the horcrux was still swinging from ron’s hand. the locket was twitching slightly. harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. it had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill harry rather than let him possess it. now was not the time for long discussions now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all. harry looked around holding hermione’s wand high and saw the place a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree. “come here,” he said and he led the way brushed snow from the rock’s surface and held out his hand for the horcrux. when ron offered the sword however harry shook his head. “no you should do it.” “me?” said ron looking shocked. “why?” “because you got the sword out of the pool. i think it’s supposed to be you.” he was not being kind or generous. as certainly as he had known that the doe was benign he knew that ron had to be the one to wield the sword. dumbledore had at least taught harry something about certain kinds of magic of the incalculable power of certain acts. “i’m going to open it,” said harry “and you stab it. straightaway okay because whatever’s in there will put up a fight. the bit of riddle in the diary tried to kill me.” “how are you going to open it?” asked ron. he looked terrified. “i’m going to ask it to open using parseltongue,” said harry. the answer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always known it deep down perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with nagini to make him realize it. he looked at the serpentine s inlaid with glittering green stones it was easy to visualize it as a minuscule snake curled upon the cold rock. “no!” said ron. “no don’t open it! i’m serious!” “why not?” asked harry. “let’s get rid of the damn thing it’s been months — ” “i can’t harry i’m serious — you do it — ” “but why?” “because that thing’s bad for me!” said ron backing away from the locket on the rock. “i can’t handle it! i’m not making excuses harry for what i was like but it affects me worse than it affected you and hermione it made me think stuff — stuff i was thinking anyway but it made everything worse i can’t explain it and then i’d take it off and i’d get my head on straight again and then i’d have to put the effing thing back on — i can’t do it harry!” he had backed away the sword dragging at his side shaking his head. “you can do it,” said harry “you can! you’ve just got the sword i know it’s supposed to be you who uses it. please just get rid of it ron.” the sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. ron swallowed then still breathing hard through his long nose moved back toward the rock. “tell me when,” he croaked. “on three,” said harry looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes concentrating on the letter s imagining a serpent while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. it would have been easy to pity it except that the cut around harry’s neck still burned. “one ... two ... three ... open.” the last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click. behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye dark and handsome as tom riddle’s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit pupiled. “stab,” said harry holding the locket steady on the rock. ron raised the sword in his shaking hands the point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes and harry gripped the locket tightly bracing himself already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows. then a voice hissed from out of the horcrux. “i have seen your heart and it is mine.” “don’t listen to it!” harry said harshly. “stab it!” “i have seen your dreams ronald weasley and i have seen your fears. all you desire is possible but all that you dread is also possible. ...” “stab!” shouted harry his voice echoed off the surrounding trees the sword point trembled and ron gazed down into riddle’s eyes. “ least loved always by the mother who craved a daughter . . . least loved now by the girl who prefers your friend . . . second best always eternally overshadowed ...” “ron stab it now!” harry bellowed he could feel the locket quivering in his grip and was scared of what was coming. ron raised the sword still higher and as he did so riddle’s eyes gleamed scarlet. out of the locket’s two windows out of the eyes there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles the heads of harry and hermione weirdly distorted. ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket first chests then waists then legs until they stood in the locket side by side like trees with a common root swaying over ron and the real harry who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned suddenly white-hot. “ron!” he shouted but the riddle-harry was now speaking with voldemort’s voice and ron was gazing mesmerized into its face. “ why return we were better without you happier without you glad of your absence. . . . we laughed at your stupidity your cowardice your presumption — ” “ presumption?’ echoed the riddle-hermione who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real hermione she swayed cackling before ron who looked horrified yet transfixed the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. “ who could look at you who would ever look at you beside harry potter what have you ever done compared with the chosen one what are you compared with the boy who lived?” “ron stab it stab it!” harry yelled but ron did not move his eyes were wide and the riddle-harry and the riddle-hermione were reflected in them their hair swirling like flames their eyes shining red their voices lifted in an evil duet. “ your mother confessed,” sneered riddle-harry while riddle-hermione jeered “that she would have preferred me as a son would be glad to exchange ...” “who wouldn’t prefer him what woman would take you you are nothing nothing nothing to him,” crooned riddle-hermione and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around riddle-harry wrapping him in a close embrace their lips met. on the ground in front of them ron’s face filled with anguish. he raised the sword high his arms shaking. “do it ron!” harry yelled. ron looked toward him and harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes. “ron — ” the sword flashed plunged harry threw himself out of the way there was a clang of metal and a long drawn-out scream. harry whirled around slipping in the snow wand held ready to defend himself but there was nothing to fight. the monstrous versions of himself and hermione were gone there was only ron standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock. slowly harry walked back to him hardly knowing what to say or do. ron was breathing heavily his eyes were no longer red at all but their normal blue they were also wet. harry stooped pretending he had not seen and picked up the broken horcrux. ron had pierced the glass in both windows riddle’s eyes were gone and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. the thing that had lived in the horcrux had vanished torturing ron had been its final act. the sword clanged as ron dropped it. he had sunk to his knees his head in his arms. he was shaking but not harry realized from cold. harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket knelt down beside ron and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. he took it as a good sign that ron did not throw it off. “after you left,” he said in a low voice grateful for the fact that ron’s face was hidden “she cried for a week. probably longer only she didn’t want me to see. there were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. with you gone ...” he could not finish it was only now that ron was here again that harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them. “she’s like my sister,” he went on. “i love her like a sister and i reckon she feels the same way about me. it’s always been like that. i thought you knew.” ron did not respond but turned his face away from harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. harry got to his feet again and walked to where ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away discarded as ron had run toward the pool to save harry from drowning. he hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to ron who clambered to his feet as harry approached eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed. “i’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “i’m sorry i left. i know i was a — a — ” he looked around at the darkness as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him. “you’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said harry. “getting the sword. finishing off the horcrux. saving my life.” “that makes me sound a lot cooler than i was,” ron mumbled. “stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said harry. “i’ve been trying to tell you that for years.” simultaneously they walked forward and hugged harry gripping the still-sopping back of ron’s jacket. “and now,” said harry as they broke apart “all we’ve got to do is find the tent again.” but it was not difficult. though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy with ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. harry could not wait to wake hermione and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent ron lagging a little behind him. it was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. hermione was fast asleep curled up under her blankets and did not move until harry had said her name several times. “hermionel” she stirred then sat up quickly pushing her hair out of her face. “what’s wrong harry are you all right?” “it’s okay everything’s fine. more than fine. i’m great. there’s someone here.” “what do you mean who — ” she saw ron who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. harry backed into a shadowy corner slipped off ron’s rucksack and attempted to blend in with the canvas. hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward ron her eyes upon his pale face. she stopped right in front of him her lips slightly parted her eyes wide. ron gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms. hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could reach. “ouch — ow — gerroff! what the —  hermione — ow!” “you — complete — arse — ronald — weasley!” she punctuated every word with a blow ron backed away shielding his head as hermione advanced. “you — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and — weeks — oh where’s my wand?” she looked as though ready to wrestle it out of harry’s hands and he reacted instinctively. “protegol” the invisible shield erupted between ron and hermione the force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. spitting hair out of her mouth she leapt up again. “hermione!” said harry. “calm — ” “i will not calm down!” she screamed. never before had he seen her lose control like this she looked quite demented. “give me back my wand! give it back to me\” “hermione will you please — ” “don’t you tell me what to do harry potter!” she screeched. “don’t you dare! give it back now! and you!” she was pointing at ron in dire accusation it was like a malediction and harry could not blame ron for retreating several steps. “i came running after you! i called you! i begged you to come back!” “i know,” ron said “hermione i’m sorry i’m really — “oh you’re sorry!” she laughed a high-pitched out-of-control sound ron looked at harry for help but harry merely grimaced his helplessness. “you come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?” “well what else can i say?” ron shouted and harry was glad that ron was fighting back. “oh i don’t know!” yelled hermione with awful sarcasm. “rack your brains ron that should only take a couple of seconds — ” “hermione,” interjected harry who considered this a low blow “he just saved my — ” “i don’t care!” she screamed. “i don’t care what he’s done! weeks and weeks we could have been dead for all he knew — ” “i knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed ron drowning her voice for the first time and approaching as close as he could with the shield charm between them. “harry’s all over the prophet all over the radio they’re looking for you everywhere all these rumors and mental stories i knew i’d hear straight off if you were dead you don’t know what it’s been like — ” “what it’s been like for you?” her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless and ron seized his opportunity. “i wanted to come back the minute i’d disapparated but i walked straight into a gang of snatchers hermione and i couldn’t go anywhere!” “a gang of what?” asked harry as hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years. “snatchers,” said ron. “they’re everywhere — gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up muggle-borns and blood traitors there’s a reward from the ministry for everyone captured. i was on my own and i look like i might be school age they got really excited thought i was a muggle-born in hiding. i had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the ministry.” “what did you say to them?” “told them i was stan shunpike. first person i could think of.” “and they believed that?” “they weren’t the brightest. one of them was definitely part troll the smell off him. ...” ron glanced at hermione clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. “anyway they had a row about whether i was stan or not. it was a bit pathetic to be honest but there were still five of them and only one of me and they’d taken my wand. then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted i managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach grabbed his wand disarmed the bloke holding mine and disapparated. i didn’t do it so well splinched myself again” — ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails hermione raised her eyebrows coldly — “and i came out miles from where you were. by the time i got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d been ... you’d gone.” “gosh what a gripping story,” hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound. “you must have been simply terrified. meanwhile we went to godric’s hollow and let’s think what happened there harry oh yes you-know who’s snake turned up it nearly killed both of us and then you-know who himself arrived and missed us by about a second.” “what?” ron said gaping from her to harry but hermione ignored him. “imagine losing fingernails harry! that really puts our sufferings into perspective doesn’t it?” “hermione,” said harry quietly “ron just saved my life.” she appeared not to have heard him. “one thing i would like to know though,” she said fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over ron’s head. “how exactly did you find us tonight that’s important. once we know we’ll be able to make sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.” ron glared at her then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. “this.” she had to look at ron to see what he was showing them. “the deluminator?” she asked so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. “it doesn’t just turn the lights on and off,” said ron. “i don’t know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time because i’ve been wanting to come back ever since i left. but i was listening to the radio really early on christmas morning and i heard ... i heard you.” he was looking at hermione. “you heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously. “no i heard you coming out of my pocket. your voice,” he held up the deluminator again “came out of this.” “and what exactly did i say?” asked hermione her tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity. “my name. ‘ron.’ and you said ... something about a wand. ...” hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. harry remembered it had been the first time ron’s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing harry’s wand. “so i took it out,” ron went on looking at the deluminator “and it didn’t seem different or anything but i was sure i’d heard you. so i clicked it. and the light went out in my room but another light appeared right outside the window.” ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him his eyes focused on something neither harry nor hermione could see. “it was a ball of light kind of pulsing and bluish like that light you get around a portkey you know?” “yeah,” said harry and hermione together automatically. “i knew this was it,” said ron. “i grabbed my stuff and packed it then i put on my rucksack and went out into the garden. “the little ball of light was hovering there waiting for me and when i came out it bobbed along a bit and i followed it behind the shed and then it ... well it went inside me.” “sorry?” said harry sure he had not heard correctly. “it sort of floated toward me,” said ron illustrating the movement with his free index finger “right to my chest and then — it just went straight through. it was here,” he touched a point close to his heart “i could feel it it was hot. and once it was inside me i knew what i was supposed to do i knew it would take me where i needed to go. so i disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. there was snow everywhere. “we were there,” said harry. “we spent two nights there and the second night i kept thinking i could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!” “yeah well that would’ve been me,” said ron. “your protective spells work anyway because i couldn’t see you and i couldn’t hear you. i was sure you were around though so in the end i got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. i thought you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.” “no actually,” said hermione. “we’ve been disapparating under the invisibility cloak as an extra precaution. and we left really early because as harry says we’d heard somebody blundering around.” “well i stayed on that hill all day,” said ron. “i kept hoping you’d appear. but when it started to get dark i knew i must have missed you so i clicked the deluminator again the blue light came out and went inside me and i disapparated and arrived here in these woods. i still couldn’t see you so i just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end — and harry did. well i saw the doe first obviously.” “you saw the what?” said hermione sharply. they explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded hermione frowned from one to the other of them concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together. “but it must have been a patronus!” she said. “couldn’t you see who was casting it didn’t you see anyone and it led you to the sword! i can’t believe this! then what happened?” ron explained how he had watched harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface how he had realized that something was wrong dived in and saved harry then returned for the sword. he got as far as the opening of the locket then hesitated and harry cut in. “ — and ron stabbed it with the sword.” “and ... and it went just like that?” she whispered. “well it — it screamed,” said harry with half a glance at ron. “here.” he threw the locket into her lap gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows. deciding that it was at last safe to do so harry removed the shield charm with a wave of hermione’s wand and turned to ron. “did you just say you got away from the snatchers with a spare wand?” “what?” said ron who had been watching hermione examining the locket. “oh — oh yeah.” he tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of its pocket. “here. i figured it’s always handy to have a backup.” “you were right,” said harry holding out his hand. “mine’s broken.” “you’re kidding?” ron said but at that moment hermione got to her feet and he looked apprehensive again. hermione put the vanquished horcrux into the beaded bag then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word. ron passed harry the new wand. “about the best you could hope for i think,” murmured harry. “yeah,” said ron. “could’ve been worse. remember those birds she set on me?” “i still haven’t ruled it out,” came hermione’s muffled voice from beneath her blankets but harry saw ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack. xen ophilius lovegood harry had not expected hermione’s anger to abate overnight and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning. ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. in fact when all three of them were together harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. during those few moments he spent alone with harry however collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms ron became shamelessly cheery. “someone helped us,” he kept saying. “someone sent that doe. someone’s on our side. one horcrux down mate!” bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other horcruxes and even though they had discussed the matter so often before harry felt optimistic certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. hermione’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits the sudden upswing in their fortunes the appearance of the mysterious doe the recovery of gryffindor’s sword and above all ron’s return made harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face. late in the afternoon he and ron escaped hermione’s baleful presence again and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries they continued their ongoing exchange of news. harry had finally managed to tell ron the whole story of his and hermione’s various wanderings right up to the full story of what had happened at godric’s hollow ron was now filling harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider wizarding world during his weeks away. ... and how did you find out about the taboo?” he asked harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of muggle-borns to evade the ministry. “the what?” “you and hermione have stopped saying you-know who’s name!” “oh yeah. well it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped into,” said harry. “but i haven’t got a problem calling him v — ” “no!” roared ron causing harry to jump into the hedge and hermione nose buried in a book at the tent entrance to scowl over at them. “sorry,” said ron wrenching harry back out of the brambles “but the name’s been jinxed harry that’s how they track people! using his name breaks protective enchantments it causes some kind of magical disturbance — it’s how they found us in tottenham court road!” “because we used his name?” “exactly! you’ve got to give them credit it makes sense. it was only people who were serious about standing up to him like dumbledore who ever dared use it. now they’ve put a taboo on it anyone who says it is trackable — quick-and-easy way to find order members! they nearly got kingsley — ” “you’re kidding?” “yeah a bunch of death eaters cornered him bill said but he fought his way out. he’s on the run now just like us.” ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. “you don’t reckon kingsley could have sent that doe?” “his patronus is a lynx we saw it at the wedding remember?” “oh yeah ...” they moved farther along the hedge away from the tent and hermione. “harry ... you don’t reckon it could’ve been dumbledore?” “dumbledore what?” ron looked a little embarrassed but said in a low voice “dumbledore ... the doe i mean,” ron was watching harry out of the corners of his eyes “he had the real sword last didn’t he?” harry did not laugh at ron because he understood too well the longing behind the question. the idea that dumbledore had managed to come back to them that he was watching over them would have been inexpressibly comforting. he shook his head. “dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “i saw it happen i saw the body. he’s definitely gone. anyway his patronus was a phoenix not a doe.” “patronuses can change though can’t they?” said ron. “tonks’s changed didn’t it?” “yeah but if dumbledore was alive why wouldn’t he show himself why wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?” “search me,” said ron. “same reason he didn’t give it to you while he was alive same reason he left you an old snitch and hermione a book of kids’ stories?” “which is what?” asked harry turning to look ron full in the face desperate for the answer. “i dunno,” said ron. “sometimes i’ve thought when i’ve been a bit hacked off he was having a laugh or — or he just wanted to make it more difficult. but i don’t think so not anymore. he knew what he was doing when he gave me the deluminator didn’t he he — well,” ron’s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet which he prodded with his toe “he must’ve known i’d run out on you.” “no,” harry corrected him. “he must’ve known you’d always want to come back.” ron looked grateful but still awkward. partly to change the subject harry said “speaking of dumbledore have you heard what skeeter wrote about him?” “oh yeah,” said ron at once “people are talking about it quite a lot. ’course if things were different it’d be huge news dumbledore being pals with grindelwald but now it’s just something to laugh about for people who didn’t like dumbledore and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. i don’t know that it’s such a big deal though. he was really young when they — ” “our age,” said harry just as he had retorted to hermione and something in his face seemed to decide ron against pursuing the subject. a large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. harry took aim at it with the wand ron had given him the previous night which hermione had since condescended to examine and had decided was made of blackthorn. “engorgio.” the spider gave a little shiver bouncing slightly in the web. harry tried again. this time the spider grew slightly larger. “stop that,” said ron sharply. “i’m sorry i said dumbledore was young okay?” harry had forgotten ron’s hatred of spiders. “sorry — reducio.” the spider did not shrink. harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. the new one felt intrusively unfamiliar like having somebody else’s hand sewn to the end of his arm. “you just need to practice,” said hermione who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. “it’s all a matter of confidence harry.” he knew why she wanted it to be all right she still felt guilty about breaking his wand. he bit back the retort that sprang to his lips that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference and he would have hers instead. keen for them all to be friends again however he agreed but when ron gave hermione a tentative smile she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. all three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell and harry took first watch. sitting in the entrance he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. hermione was lying on her bunk reading while ron after many nervous glances up at her had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it. “there’s this one program,” he told harry in a low voice “that tells the news like it really is. all the others are on you know who’s side and are following the ministry line but this one ... you wait till you hear it it’s great. only they can’t do it every night they have to keep changing locations in case they’re raided and you need a password to tune in. ... trouble is i missed the last one. ...” he drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his breath. he threw hermione many covert glances plainly fearing an angry outburst but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there. for ten minutes or so ron tapped and muttered hermione turned the pages of her book and harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand. finally hermione climbed down from her bunk. ron ceased his tapping at once. “if it’s annoying you 111 stop!” he told hermione nervously. hermione did not deign to respond but approached harry. “we need to talk,” she said. he looked at the book still clutched in her hand. it was the life and lies of albus dumbledore. “what?” he said apprehensively. it flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there he was not sure he felt up to hearing rita’s version of his relationship with dumbledore. hermione ’s answer however was completely unexpected. “i want to go and see xenophilius lovegood.” he stared at her. “sorry?” “xenophilius lovegood. luna’s father. i want to go and talk to him!” “er — why?” she took a deep breath as though bracing herself and said “it’s that mark the mark in beedle the bard. look at this!” she thrust the life and lies ofalbus dumbledore under harry’s unwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that dumbledore had written grindelwald with dumbledore ’s familiar thin slanting handwriting. he hated seeing absolute proof that dumbledore really had written those words that they had not been rita’s invention. “the signature,” said hermione. “look at the signature harry!” he obeyed. for a moment he had no idea what she was talking about but looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand he saw that dumbledore had replaced the a of albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon the tales of beedle the bard. “er — what are you — ” said ron tentatively but hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to harry. “it keeps cropping up doesn’t it?” she said. “i know viktor said it was grindelwald ’s mark but it was definitely on that old grave in godric’s hollow and the dates on the headstone were long before grindelwald came along! and now this! well we can’t ask dumbledore or grindelwald what it means — i don’t even know whether grindelwald’s still alive — but we can ask mr. lovegood. he was wearing the symbol at the wedding. i’m sure this is important harry!” harry did not answer immediately. he looked into her intense eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness thinking. after a long pause he said “hermione we don’t need another godric’s hollow. we talked ourselves into going there and — ” “but it keeps appearing harry! dumbledore left me the tales of beedle the bard how do you know we’re not supposed to find out about the sign?” “here we go again!” harry felt slightly exasperated. “we keep trying to convince ourselves dumbledore left us secret signs and clues — ” “the deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up ron. “i think hermione’s right i think we ought to go and see lovegood.” harry threw him a dark look. he was quite sure that ron’s support of hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. “it won’t be like godric’s hollow,” ron added “lovegood’s on your side harry the quibbler’s been for you all along it keeps telling everyone they’ve got to help you!” “i’m sure this is important!” said hermione earnestly. “but don’t you think if it was dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?” “maybe ... maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws. “yeah,” said ron sycophantically “that makes sense.” “no it doesn’t,” snapped hermione “but i still think we ought to talk to mr. lovegood. a symbol that links dumbledore grindelwald and godric’s hollow harry i’m sure we ought to know about this!” “i think we should vote on it,” said ron. “those in favor of going to see lovegood — ” his hand flew into the air before hermione’s. her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own. “outvoted harry sorry,” said ron clapping him on the back. “fine,” said harry half amused half irritated. “only once we’ve seen lovegood let’s try and look for some more horcruxes shall we where do the lovegoods live anyway do either of you know?” “yeah they’re not far from my place,” said ron. “i dunno exactly where but mum and dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. shouldn’t be hard to find.” when hermione had returned to her bunk harry lowered his voice. “you only agreed to try and get back in her good books.” “all’s fair in love and war,” said ron brightly “and this is a bit of both. cheer up it’s the christmas holidays luna ’ll be home!” they had an excellent view of the village of ottery st. catchpole from the breezy hillside to which they disapparated next morning. from their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. they stood for a minute or two looking toward the burrow their hands shadowing their eyes but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard which afforded the crooked little house protection from muggle eyes. “it’s weird being this near but not going to visit,” said ron. “well it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. you were there for christmas,” said hermione coldly. “i wasn’t at the burrow!” said ron with an incredulous laugh. “do you think i was going to go back there and tell them all i’d walked out on you yeah fred and george would’ve been great about it. and ginny she’d have been really understanding.” “but where have you been then?” asked hermione surprised. “bill and fleur’s new place. shell cottage. bill’s always been decent to me. he — he wasn’t impressed when he heard what i’d done but he didn’t go on about it. he knew i was really sorry. none of the rest of the family know i was there. bill told mum he and fleur weren’t going home for christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. you know first holiday after they were married. i don’t think fleur minded. you know how much she hates celestina warbeck.” ron turned his back on the burrow. “let’s try up here,” he said leading the way over the top of the hill. they walked for a few hours harry at hermione ’s insistence hidden beneath the invisibility cloak. the cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage which seemed deserted. “do you think it’s theirs and they’ve gone away for christmas?” said hermione peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. ron snorted. “listen i’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the lovegoods’ window. let’s try the next lot of hills.” so they disapparated a few miles farther north. “aha!” shouted ron as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. ron was pointing upward toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. “that’s got to be luna’s house who else would live in a place like that it looks like a giant rook!” “it’s nothing like a bird,” said hermione frowning at the tower. “i was talking about a chess rook,” said ron. “a castle to you.” ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. when harry and hermione caught up with him panting and clutching stitches in their sides they found him grinning broadly. “it’s theirs,” said ron. “look.” three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down gate. the first read the quibbler. editor x. lovegood the second pick your own mistletoe the third keep off the dirigible plums the gate creaked as they opened it. the zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants including a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit luna sometimes wore as earrings. harry thought he recognized a snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. two aged crab apple trees bent with the wind stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe stood sentinel on either side of the front door. a little owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches. “you’d better take off the invisibility cloak harry,” said hermione. “it’s you mr. lovegood wants to help not us.” he did as she suggested handing her the cloak to stow in the beaded bag. she then rapped three times on the thick black door which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle. barely ten seconds passed then the door was flung open and there stood xenophilius lovegood barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt his long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. xenophilius had been positively dapper at bill and fleur’s wedding by comparison. “what what is it who are you what do you want?” he cried in a high-pitched querulous voice looking first at hermione then at ron and finally at harry upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical o. “hello mr. lovegood,” said harry holding out his hand. “i’m harry harry potter.” xenophilius did not take harry’s hand although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on harry’s forehead. “would it be okay if we came in?” asked harry. “there’s something we’d like to ask you.” “i ... i’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered xenophilius. he swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. “rather a shock ... my word ... i ... i’m afraid i don’t really think i ought to — ” “it won’t take long,” said harry slightly disappointed by this less-than-warm welcome. “i — oh all right then. come in quickly. quicklyv’ they were barely over the threshold when xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them. they were standing in the most peculiar kitchen harry had ever seen. the room was perfectly circular so that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. everything was curved to fit the walls — the stove the sink and the cupboards — and all of it had been painted with flowers insects and birds in bright primary colors. harry thought he recognized luna’s style the effect in such an enclosed space was slightly overwhelming. in the middle of the floor a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. there was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead harry wondered what luna could be doing. “you’d better come up,” said xenophilius still looking extremely uncomfortable and he led the way. the room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace and as such was even more cluttered than the kitchen. though much smaller and entirely round the room somewhat resembled the room of requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. there were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. delicately made models of creatures harry did not recognize all flapping wings or snapping jaws hung from the ceiling. luna was not there the thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. it looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves but after a moment harry deduced that it was an old fashioned printing press due to the fact that it was churning out quibblers. “excuse me,” said xenophilius and he strode over to the machine seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers which all tumbled onto the floor and threw it over the press somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. he then faced harry. “why have you come here?” before harry could speak however hermione let out a small cry of shock. “mr. lovegood — what’s that?” she was pointing at an enormous gray spiral horn not unlike that of a unicorn which had been mounted on the wall protruding several feet into the room. “it is the horn of a crumple-horned snorkack,” said xenophilius. “no it isn’t!” said hermione. “hermione,” muttered harry embarrassed “now’s not the moment — ” “but harry it’s an erumpent horn! it’s a class b tradeable material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!” “how d’you know it’s an erumpent horn?” asked ron edging away from the horn as fast as he could given the extreme clutter of the room. “there’s a description in fantastic beasts and where to find them .! mr. lovegood you need to get rid of it straightaway don’t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?” “the crumple-horned snorkack,” said xenophilius very clearly a mulish look upon his face “is a shy and highly magical creature and its horn — ” “mr. lovegood i recognize the grooved markings around the base that’s an erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous — i don’t know where you got it “i bought it,” said xenophilius dogmatically “two weeks ago from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite snorkack. a christmas surprise for my luna. now,” he said turning to harry “why exactly have you come here mr. potter?” “we need some help,” said harry before hermione could start again. “ah,” said xenophilius. “help. hmm.” his good eye moved again to harry’s scar. he seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized. “yes. the thing is ... helping harry potter ... rather dangerous ...” “aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help harry?” said ron. “in that magazine of yours?” xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth. “er — yes i have expressed that view. however — ” “that’s for everyone else to do not you personally?” said ron. xenophilius did not answer. he kept swallowing his eyes darting between the three of them. harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle. “where’s luna?” asked hermione. “let’s see what she thinks.” xenophilius gulped. he seemed to be steeling himself. finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press “luna is down at the stream fishing for freshwater plimpies. she ... she will like to see you. i’ll go and call her and then — yes very well. i shall try to help you.” he disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. they looked at each other. “cowardly old wart,” said ron. “luna’s got ten times his guts.” “he’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the death eaters find out i was here,” said harry. “well i agree with ron,” said hermione. “awful old hypocrite telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. and for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.” harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. he could see a stream a thin glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. they were very high up a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the burrow now invisible beyond another line of hills. ginny was over there somewhere. they were closer to each other today than they had been since bill and fleur’s wedding but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now thinking of her. he supposed he ought to be glad of it anyone he came into contact with was in danger xenophilius’s attitude proved that. he turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered curved sideboard a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides. a tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead. “look at this,” said harry. “fetching,” said ron. “surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.” they heard the front door close and a moment later xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room his thin legs now encased in wellington boots bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot. “ah you have spotted my pet invention,” he said shoving the tray into hermione’s arms and joining harry at the statue’s side. “modeled fittingly enough upon the head of the beautiful rowena ravenclaw. ‘wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasurev ” he indicated the objects like ear trumpets. “these are the wrackspurt siphons — to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker’s immediate area. here,” he pointed out the tiny wings “a billywig propeller to induce an elevated frame of mind. finally,” he pointed to the orange radish “the dirigible plum so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.” xenophilius strode back to the tea tray which hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables. “may i offer you all an infusion of gurdyroots?” said xenophilius. “we make it ourselves.” as he started to pour out the drink which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice he added “luna is down beyond bottom bridge she is most excited that you are here. she ought not to be too long she has caught nearly enough plimpies to make soup for all of us. do sit down and help yourselves to sugar. “now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down his wellingtoned legs crossed “how may i help you mr. potter?” “well,” said harry glancing at hermione who nodded encouragingly “it’s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at bill and fleur’s wedding mr. lovegood. we wondered what it meant.” xenophilius raised his eyebrows. “are you referring to the sign of the deathly hallows?” the tale of the three brothers harry turned to look at ron and hermione. neither of them seemed to have understood what xenophilius had said either. “the deathly hallows?” “that’s right,” said xenophilius. “you haven’t heard of them i’m not surprised. very very few wizards believe. witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at ron “who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known dark wizard! such ignorance. there is nothing dark about the hallows — at least not in that crude sense. one simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers in the hope that they might help one with the quest.” he stirred several lumps of sugar into his gurdyroot infusion and drank some. “i’m sorry,” said harry. “i still don’t really understand.” to be polite he took a sip from his cup too and almost gagged the stuff was quite disgusting as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored every flavor beans. “well you see believers seek the deathly hallows,” said xenophilius smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the gurdyroot infusion. “but what are the deathly hallows?” asked hermione. xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. “i assume that you are all familiar with “the tale of the three brothers’?” harry said “no,” but ron and hermione both said “yes.” xenophilius nodded gravely. “well well mr. potter the whole thing starts with the tale of the three brothers’ ... i have a copy somewhere. ...” he glanced vaguely around the room at the piles of parchment and books but hermione said “i’ve got a copy mr. lovegood i’ve got it right here.” and she pulled out the tales of beedle the bard from the small beaded bag. “the original?” inquired xenophilius sharply and when she nodded he said “well then why don’t you read it aloud much the best way to make sure we all understand.” “er ... all right,” said hermione nervously. she opened the book and harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough and began to read. “ ‘there were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight — ’ ” “midnight our mum always told us,” said ron who had stretched out arms behind his head to listen. hermione shot him a look of annoyance. “sorry i just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” said ron. “yeah because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said harry before he could stop himself. xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention but was staring out of the window at the sky. “go on hermione.” “ ‘in time the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. however these brothers were learned in the magical arts and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. they were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. “ ‘and death spoke to them — ’ ” “sorry,” interjected harry “but death spoke to them?” “it’s a fairy tale harry!” “right sorry. go on.” “ ‘and death spoke to them. he was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims for travelers usually drowned in the river. but death was cunning. he pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. “ ‘so the oldest brother who was a combative man asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence a wand that must always win duels for its owner a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered death! so death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there and gave it to the oldest brother. “ ‘then the second brother who was an arrogant man decided that he wanted to humiliate death still further and asked for the power to recall others from death. so death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. “ ‘and then death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. the youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers and he did not trust death. so he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by death. and death most unwillingly handed over his own cloak of invisibility.’ ” “death’s got an invisibility cloak?” harry interrupted again. “so he can sneak up on people,” said ron. “sometimes he gets bored of running at them flapping his arms and shrieking ... sorry hermione.” “ ‘then death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring death’s gifts. “ ‘in due course the brothers separated each for his own destination. “ ‘the first brother traveled on for a week or more and reaching a distant village sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. naturally with the elder wand as his weapon he could not fail to win the duel that followed. leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from death himself and of how it made him invincible. “ ‘that very night another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay wine-sodden upon his bed. the thief took the wand and for good measure slit the oldest brother’s throat. “ ‘and so death took the first brother for his own. “ ‘meanwhile the second brother journeyed to his own home where he lived alone. here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead and turned it thrice in his hand. to his amazement and his delight the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared at once before him. “ ‘yet she was sad and cold separated from him as by a veil. though she had returned to the mortal world she did not truly belong there and suffered. finally the second brother driven mad with hopeless longing killed himself so as truly to join her. “ ‘and so death took the second brother for his own. “ ‘but though death searched for the third brother for many years he was never able to find him. it was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the cloak of invisibility and gave it to his son. and then he greeted death as an old friend and went with him gladly and equals they departed this life. ’ ” hermione closed the book. it was a moment or two before xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said “well there you are.” “sorry?” said hermione sounding confused. “those are the deathly hallows,” said xenophilius. he picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books. “the elder wand,” he said and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. “the resurrection stone,” he said and he added a circle on top of the line. “the cloak of invisibility,” he finished enclosing both line and circle in a triangle to make the symbol that so intrigued hermione. “together,” he said “the deathly hallows.” “but there’s no mention of the words ‘deathly hallows’ in the story,” said hermione. “well of course not,” said xenophilius maddeningly smug. “that is a children’s tale told to amuse rather than to instruct. those of us who understand these matters however recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects or hallows which if united will make the possessor master of death.” there was a short silence in which xenophilius glanced out of the window. already the sun was low in the sky. “luna ought to have enough plimpies soon,” he said quietly. “when you say ‘master of death’ — ” said ron. “master,” said xenophilius waving an airy hand. “conqueror. vanquisher. whichever term you prefer.” “but then ... do you mean ...” said hermione slowly and harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice “that you believe these objects — these hallows — actually exist?” xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. “well of course.” “but,” said hermione and harry could hear her restraint starting to crack “mr. lovegood how can you possibly believe — ” “luna has told me all about you young lady,” said xenophilius. “you are i gather not unintelligent but painfully limited. narrow. close-minded.” “perhaps you ought to try on the hat hermione,” said ron nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. his voice shook with the strain of not laughing. “mr. lovegood,” hermione began again. “we all know that there are such things as invisibility cloaks. they are rare but they exist. but — ” “ah but the third hallow is a true cloak of invisibility miss granger! i mean to say it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a disillusionment charm or carrying a bedazzling hex or else woven from demiguise hair which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. we are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible and endures eternally giving constant and impenetrable concealment no matter what spells are cast at it. how many cloaks have you ever seen like that miss granger?” hermione opened her mouth to answer then closed it again looking more confused than ever. she harry and ron glanced at one another and harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. it so happened that a cloak exactly like the one xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. “exactly,” said xenophilius as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. “none of you have ever seen such a thing. the possessor would be immeasurably rich would he not?” he glanced out of the window again. the sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. “all right,” said hermione disconcerted. “say the cloak existed ... what about the stone mr. lovegood the thing you call the resurrection stone?” “what of it?” “well how can that be real?” “prove that it is not,” said xenophilius. hermione looked outraged. “but that’s — i’m sorry but that’s completely ridiculous! how can i possibly prove it doesn’t exist do you expect me to get hold of — of all the pebbles in the world and test them i mean you could claim that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist!” “yes you could,” said xenophilius. “i am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.” “so the elder wand,” said harry quickly before hermione could retort “you think that exists too?” “oh well in that case there is endless evidence,” said xenophilius. “the elder wand is the hallow that is most easily traced because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.” “which is what?” asked harry. “which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner if he is to be truly master of it,” said xenophilius. “surely you have heard of the way the wand came to egbert the egregious after his slaughter of emeric the evil of how godelot died in his own cellar after his son hereward took the wand from him of the dreadful loxias who took the wand from barnabas deverill whom he had killed the bloody trail of the elder wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history.” harry glanced at hermione. she was frowning at xenophilius but she did not contradict him. “so where do you think the elder wand is now?” asked ron. “alas who knows?” said xenophilius as he gazed out of the window. “who knows where the elder wand lies hidden the trail goes cold with arcus and livius. who can say which of them really defeated loxias and which took the wand and who can say who may have defeated them history alas does not tell us.” there was a pause. finally hermione asked stiffly “mr. lovegood does the peverell family have anything to do with the deathly hallows?” xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in harry’s memory but he could not locate it. peverell ...he had heard that name before. ... “but you have been misleading me young woman!” said xenophilius now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at hermione. “i thought you were new to the hallows quest! many of us questers believe that the peverells have everything — everything ! — to do with the hallows!” “who are the peverells?” asked ron. “that was the name on the grave with the mark on it in godric’s hollow,” said hermione still watching xenophilius. “ignotus peverell.” “exactly!” said xenophilius his forefinger raised pedantically. “the sign of the deathly hallows on ignotus ’s grave is conclusive proof!” “of what?” asked ron. “why that the three brothers in the story were actually the three peverell brothers antioch cadmus and ignotus! that they were the original owners of the hallows!” with another glance at the window he got to his feet picked up the tray and headed for the spiral staircase. “you will stay for dinner?” he called as he vanished downstairs again. “everybody always requests our recipe for freshwater plimpy soup.” “probably to show the poisoning department at st. mungo’s,” said ron under his breath. harry waited until they could hear xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking. “what do you think?” he asked hermione. “oh harry,” she said wearily “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. this can’t be what the sign really means. this must just be his weird take on it. what a waste of time.” “i s’pose this is the man who brought us crumple horned snorkacks,” said ron. “you don’t believe it either?” harry asked him. “nah that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons isn’t it ‘don’t go looking for trouble don’t pick fights don’t go messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! just keep your head down mind your own business and you’ll be okay’ come to think of it,” ron added “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.” “what are you talking about?” “one of those superstitions isn’t it ‘may-born witches will marry muggles.’ ‘jinx by twilight undone by midnight.’ ‘wand of elder never prosper.’ you must’ve heard them. my mum’s full of them.” “harry and i were raised by muggles,” hermione reminded him. “we were taught different superstitions.” she sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. the one good thing about her exasperation with xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at ron. “i think you’re right,” she told him. “it’s just a morality tale it’s obvious which gift is best which one you’d choose — ” the three of them spoke at the same time hermione said “the cloak,” ron said “the wand,” and harry said “the stone.” they looked at each other half surprised half amused. “you’re supposed to say the cloak,” ron told hermione “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand. an unbeatable wand hermione come on!” “we’ve already got an invisibility cloak,” said harry. “and it’s helped us rather a lot in case you hadn’t noticed!” said hermione. “whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble — ” “only if you shouted about it,” argued ron. “only if you were prat enough to go dancing around waving it over your head and singing ‘i’ve got an unbeatable wand come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough.’ as long as you kept your trap shut — ” “yes but could you keep your trap shut?” said hermione looking skeptical. “you know the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra powerful wands for hundreds of years.” “there have?” asked harry. hermione looked exasperated the expression was so endearingly familiar that harry and ron grinned at each other. “the deathstick the wand of destiny they crop up under different names through the centuries usually in the possession of some dark wizard who’s boasting about them. professor binns mentioned some of them but — oh it’s all nonsense. wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s.” “but how do you know,” said harry “that those wands — the deathstick and the wand of destiny — aren’t the same wand surfacing over the centuries under different names?” “what and they’re all really the elder wand made by death?” said ron. harry laughed the strange idea that had occurred to him was after all ridiculous. his wand he reminded himself had been of holly not elder and it had been made by ollivander whatever it had done that night voldemort had pursued him across the skies. and if it had been unbeatable how could it have been broken “so why would you take the stone?” ron asked him. “well if you could bring people back we could have sirius ... mad-eye ... dumbledore ... my parents. ...” neither ron nor hermione smiled. “but according to beedle the bard they wouldn’t want to come back would they?” said harry thinking about the tale they had just heard. “i don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead have there?” he asked hermione. “no,” she replied sadly. “i don’t think anyone except mr. lovegood could kid themselves that’s possible. beedle probably took the idea from the sorcerer’s stone you know instead of a stone to make you immortal a stone to reverse death.” the smell from the kitchen was getting stronger it was something like burning underpants. harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. “what about the cloak though?” said ron slowly. “don’t you realize he’s right i’ve got so used to harry’s cloak and how good it is i never stopped to think. i’ve never heard of one like harry’s. it’s infallible. we’ve never been spotted under it — ” “of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it ron!” “but all the stuff he said about other cloaks and they’re not exactly ten a knut you know is true! it’s never occurred to me before but i’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in. harry’s was owned by his dad so it’s not exactly new is it but it’s just ... perfect!” “yes all right but ron the stone ...” as they argued in whispers harry moved around the room only half listening. reaching the spiral stair he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. his own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. after a moment’s bewilderment he realized that it was not a mirror but a painting. curious he began to climb the stairs. “harry what are you doing i don’t think you should look around when he’s not here!” but harry had already reached the next level. luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces harry ron hermione ginny and neville. they were not moving as the portraits at hogwarts moved but there was a certain magic about them all the same harry thought they breathed. what appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures linking them together but after examining them for a minute or so harry realized that the chains were actually one word repeated a thousand times in golden ink friends . . . friends . . . friends . . . harry felt a great rush of affection for luna. he looked around the room. there was a large photograph beside the bed of a young luna and a woman who looked very like her. they were hugging. luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than harry had ever seen her in life. the picture was dusty. this struck harry as slightly odd. he stared around. something was wrong. the pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. there were no clothes in the wardrobe whose doors stood ajar. the bed had a cold unfriendly look as though it had not been slept in for weeks. a single cobweb stretched over the nearest window across a bloodred sky. “what’s wrong?” hermione asked as harry descended the staircase but before he could respond xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen now holding a tray laden with bowls. “mr. lovegood,” said harry. “where’s luna?” “excuse me?” “where’s luna?” xenophilius halted on the top step. “i — i’ve already told you. she is down at bottom bridge fishing for plimpies.” “so why have you only laid that tray for four?” xenophilius tried to speak but no sound came out. the only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press and a slight rattle from the tray as xenophilius ’s hands shook. “i don’t think luna’s been here for weeks,” said harry. “her clothes are gone her bed hasn’t been slept in. where is she and why do you keep looking out of the window?” xenophilius dropped the tray the bowls bounced and smashed. harry ron and hermione drew their wands xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket. at that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth the press fell silent at last. hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines her wand still pointing at mr. lovegood. “harry look at this.” he strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. the front of the quibbler carried his own picture emblazoned with the words undesirable number one and captioned with the reward money. “the quibbler’s going for a new angle then?” harry asked coldly his mind working very fast. “is that what you were doing when you went into the garden mr. lovegood sending an owl to the ministry?” xenophilius licked his lips. “they took my luna,” he whispered. “because of what i’ve been writing. they took my luna and i don’t know where she is what they’ve done to her. but they might give her back to me if i — if i — ” “hand over harry?” hermione finished for him. “no deal,” said ron flatly. “get out of the way we’re leaving.” xenophilius looked ghastly a century old his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. “they will be here at any moment. i must save luna. i cannot lose luna. you must not leave.” he spread his arms in front of the staircase and harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib. “don’t make us hurt you,” harry said. “get out of the way mr. lovegood.” “harry!” hermione screamed. figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. as the three of them looked away from him xenophilius drew his wand. harry realized their mistake just in time he launched himself sideways shoving ron and hermione out of harm’s way as xenophilius’s stunning spell soared across the room and hit the erumpent horn. there was a colossal explosion. the sound of it seemed to blow the room apart fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. harry flew through the air then crashed to the floor unable to see as debris rained upon him his arms over his head. he heard hermione’s scream ron’s yell and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. half buried in rubble harry tried to raise himself he could barely breathe or see for dust. half of the ceiling had fallen in and the end of luna’s bed was hanging through the hole. the bust of rowena ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air and most of the printing press lay on its side blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. then another white shape moved close by and hermione coated in dust like a second statue pressed her finger to her lips. the door downstairs crashed open. “didn’t i tell you there was no need to hurry travers?” said a rough voice. “didn’t 1 tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?” there was a bang and a scream of pain from xenophilius. “no ... no ... upstairs ... potter!” “i told you last week lovegood we weren’t coming back for anything less than some solid information! remember last week when you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress and the week before” — another bang another squeal — “when you thought we’d give her back if you offered us proof there are crumple” — bang — “headed” — bang — “snorkacks?” “no — no — i beg you!” sobbed xenophilius. “it really is potter! really!” “and now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!” roared the death eater and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from xenophilius. “the place looks like it’s about to fall in selwyn,” said a cool second voice echoing up the mangled staircase. “the stairs are completely blocked. could try clearing it might bring the place down.” “you lying piece of filth,” shouted the wizard named selwyn. “you’ve never seen potter in your life have you thought you’d lure us here to kill us did you and you think you’ll get your girl back like this?” “i swear ... i swear ... potter’s upstairs!” “homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the stairs. harry heard hermione gasp and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him immersing his body in its shadow. “there’s someone up there all right selwyn,” said the second man sharply. “it’s potter i tell you it’s potter!” sobbed xenophilius. “please ... please ... give me luna just let me have luna. ...” “you can have your little girl lovegood,” said selwyn “if you get up those stairs and bring me down harry potter. but if this is a plot if it’s a trick if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.” xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. there were scurryings and scrapings xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. “come on,” harry whispered “we’ve got to get out of here.” he started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise xenophilius was making on the staircase. ron was buried deepest harry and hermione climbed as quietly as they could over all the wreckage to where he lay trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. while xenophilius ’s banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer hermione managed to free ron with the use of a hover charm. “all right,” breathed hermione as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble xenophilius was feet away from them. she was still white with dust. “do you trust me harry?” harry nodded. “okay then,” hermione whispered “give me the invisibility cloak. ron you’re going to put it on.” “me but harry — ” “please ron harry hold on tight to my hand ron grab my shoulder.” harry held out his left hand. ron vanished beneath the cloak. the printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating xenophilius was trying to shift it using a hover charm. harry did not know what hermione was waiting for. “hold tight,” she whispered. “hold tight ... any second xenophilius’s paper white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. “obliviate\” cried hermione pointing her wand first into his face then at the floor beneath them. “deprimo\” she had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. they fell like boulders harry still holding onto her hand for dear life there was a scream from below and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in harry’s ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. the deathly hallows harry fell panting onto grass and scrambled up at once. they seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at dusk hermione was already running in a circle around them waving her wand. “protego totalum ... salvio hexia ...” “that treacherous old bleeder!” ron panted emerging from beneath the invisibility cloak and throwing it to harry. “hermione you’re a genius a total genius i can’t believe we got out of that!” “ cave inimicum ... didn’t i say it was an erumpent horn didn’t i tell him and now his house has been blown apart!” “serves him right,” said ron examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs. “what d’you reckon they’ll do to him?” “oh i hope they don’t kill him!” groaned hermione. “that’s why i wanted the death eaters to get a glimpse of harry before we left so they knew xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” “why hide me though?” asked ron. “you’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit ron! they’ve kidnapped luna because her father supported harry! what would happen to your family if they knew you’re with him?” “but what about your mum and dad?” “they’re in australia,” said hermione. “they should be all right. they don’t know anything.” “you’re a genius,” ron repeated looking awed. “yeah you are hermione,” agreed harry fervently. “i don’t know what we’d do without you.” she beamed but became solemn at once. “what about luna?” “well if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive — ” began ron. “don’t say that don’t say it!” squealed hermione. “she must be alive she must!” “then she’ll be in azkaban i expect,” said ron. “whether she survives the place though ... loads don’t. ...” “she will,” said harry. he could not bear to contemplate the alternative. “she’s tough luna much tougher than you’d think. she’s probably teaching all the inmates about wrackspurts and nargles.” “i hope you’re right,” said hermione. she passed a hand over her eyes. “i’d feel so sorry for xenophilius if “ — if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the death eaters yeah,” said ron. they put up the tent and retreated inside it where ron made them tea. after their narrow escape the chilly musty old place felt like home safe familiar and friendly. “oh why did we go there?” groaned hermione after a few minutes’ silence. “harry you were right it was godric’s hollow all over again a complete waste of time! the deathly hallows ... such rubbish ... although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have struck her “he might have made it all up mightn’t he he probably doesn’t believe in the deathly hallows at all he just wanted to keep us talking until the death eaters arrived!” “i don’t think so,” said ron. “it’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. i found that out when the snatchers caught me. it was much easier pretending to be stan because i knew a bit about him than inventing a whole new person. old lovegood was under loads of pressure trying to make sure we stayed put. i reckon he told us the truth or what he thinks is the truth just to keep us talking.” “well i don’t suppose it matters,” sighed hermione. “even if he was being honest i never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.” “hang on though,” said ron. “the chamber of secrets was supposed to be a myth wasn’t it?” “but the deathly hallows can’t exist ron!” “you keep saying that but one of them can,” said ron. “harry’s invisibility cloak — ” “ the tale of the three brothers’ is a story,” said hermione firmly. “a story about how humans are frightened of death. if surviving was as simple as hiding under the invisibility cloak we’d have everything we need already!” “i don’t know. we could do with an unbeatable wand,” said harry turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers. “there’s no such thing harry!” “you said there have been loads of wands — the deathstick and whatever they were called — ” “all right even if you want to kid yourself the elder wand’s real what about the resurrection stone?” her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name and her tone dripped sarcasm. “no magic can raise the dead and that’s that!” “when my wand connected with you-know-who’s it made my mum and dad appear ... and cedric ...” “but they weren’t really back from the dead were they?” said hermione. “those kinds of — of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.” “but she the girl in the tale didn’t really come back did she the story says that once people are dead they belong with the dead. but the second brother still got to see her and talk to her didn’t he he even lived with her for a while. ...” he saw concern and something less easily definable in hermione’s expression. then as she glanced at ron harry realized that it was fear he had scared her with his talk of living with dead people. “so that peverell bloke who’s buried in godric’s hollow,” he said hastily trying to sound robustly sane “you don’t know anything about him then?” “no,” she replied looking relieved at the change of subject. “i looked him up after i saw the mark on his grave if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important i’m sure he’d be in one of our books. the only place i’ve managed to find the name ‘peverell’ is nature’s nobility a wizarding genealogy. i borrowed it from kreacher,” she explained as ron raised his eyebrows. “it lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. apparently the peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.” “ ‘extinct in the male line’?” repeated ron. “it means the name’s died out,” said hermione “centuries ago in the case of the peverells. they could still have descendants though they’d just be called something different.” and then it came to harry in one shining piece the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name “peverell” a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a ministry official and he cried aloud “marvolo gaunt!” “sorry?” said ron and hermione together. “marvolo gaunti you know who’s grandfather! in the pensieve! with dumbledore! marvolo gaunt said he was descended from the peverells!” ron and hermione looked bewildered. “the ring the ring that became the horcrux marvolo gaunt said it had the peverell coat of arms on it! i saw him waving it in the bloke from the ministry’s face he nearly shoved it up his nose!” “the peverell coat of arms?” said hermione sharply. “could you see what it looked like?” “not really,” said harry trying to remember. “there was nothing fancy on there as far as i could see maybe a few scratches. i only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.” harry saw hermione ’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. ron was looking from one to the other astonished. “blimey ... you reckon it was this sign again the sign of the hallows?” “why not?” said harry excitedly. “marvolo gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig all he cared about was his ancestry. if that ring had been passed down through the centuries he might not have known what it really was. there were no books in that house and trust me he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. he’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms because as far as he was concerned having pure blood made you practically royal.” “yes ... and that’s all very interesting,” said hermione cautiously “but harry if you’re thinking what i think you’re think — ” “well why not why not?” said harry abandoning caution. “it was a stone wasn’t it?” he looked at ron for support. “what if it was the resurrection stone?” ron’s mouth fell open. “blimey — but would it still work if dumbledore broke — ” “work work ron it never worked! there’s no such thing as a resurrection stone\” hermione had leapt to her feet looking exasperated and angry. “harry you’re trying to fit everything into the hallows story — ” “fit everything in?” he repeated. “hermione it fits of its own accord! i know the sign of the deathly hallows was on that stone! gaunt said he was descended from the peverells!” “a minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!” “where d’you reckon the ring is now?” ron asked harry. “what did dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?” but harry’s imagination was racing ahead far beyond ron and hermione ’s. ... three objects or hallows which if united will make the possessor master of death . . . master . . . conqueror ... vanquisher ... the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . . and he saw himself possessor of the hallows facing voldemort whose horcruxes were no match ... neither can live while the other survives. ... was this the answer hallows versus horcruxes was there a way after all to ensure that he was the one who triumphed if he were the master of the deathly hallows would he be safe “harry?” but he scarcely heard hermione he had pulled out his invisibility cloak and was running it through his fingers the cloth supple as water light as air. he had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the wizarding world. the cloak was exactly what xenophilius had described a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible and endures eternally giving constant and impenetrable concealment no matter what spells are cast at it ... and then with a gasp he remembered — “dumbledore had my cloak the night my parents died!” his voice shook and he could feel the color in his face but he did not care. “my mum told sirius that dumbledore borrowed the cloak! this is why! he wanted to examine it because he thought it was the third hallow! ignotus peverell is buried in godric’s hollow. ...” harry was walking blindly around the tent feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. “he’s my ancestor! i’m descended from the third brother! it all makes sense!” he felt armed in certainty in his belief in the hallows as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. “harry,” said hermione again but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck his fingers shaking hard. “read it,” he told her pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. “read it! dumbledore had the cloak hermione! why else would he want it he didn’t need a cloak he could perform a disillusionment charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!” something fell to the floor and rolled glittering under a chair he had dislodged the snitch when he pulled out the letter. he stooped to pick it up and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out. “it’s in here! he left me the ring — it’s in the snitch!” “you — you reckon?” he could not understand why ron looked taken aback. it was so obvious so clear to harry everything fit everything. . . . his cloak was the third hallow and when he discovered how to open the snitch he would have the second and then all he needed to do was find the first hallow the elder wand and then — but it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage all his excitement all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke and he stood alone in the darkness and the glorious spell was broken. “that’s what he’s after.” the change in his voice made ron and hermione look even more scared. “you-know-who’s after the elder wand.” he turned his back on their strained incredulous faces. he knew it was the truth. it all made sense. voldemort was not seeking a new wand he was seeking an old wand a very old wand indeed. harry walked to the entrance of the tent forgetting about ron and hermione as he looked out into the night thinking. ... voldemort had been raised in a muggle orphanage. nobody could have told him the tales of beedle the bard when he was a child any more than harry had heard them. hardly any wizards believed in the deathly hallows. was it likely that voldemort knew about them harry gazed into the darkness. ... if voldemort had known about the deathly hallows surely he would have sought them done anything to possess them three objects that made the possessor master of death if he had known about the deathly hallows he might not have needed horcruxes in the first place. didn’t the simple fact that he had taken a hallow and turned it into a horcrux demonstrate that he did not know this last great wizarding secret which meant that voldemort sought the elder wand without realizing its full power without understanding that it was one of three . . . for the wand was the hallow that could not be hidden whose existence was best known. ... the bloody trail of the elder wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history . . . harry watched the cloudy sky curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. he felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. he turned back into the tent. it was a shock to see ron and hermione standing exactly where he had left them hermione still holding lily’s letter ron at her side looking slightly anxious. didn’t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes “this is it,” harry said trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty. “this explains everything. the deathly hallows are real and i’ve got one — maybe two — ” he held up the snitch. “ — and you-know-who’s chasing the third but he doesn’t realize ... he just thinks it’s a powerful wand “harry,” said hermione moving across to him and handing him back lily’s letter “i’m sorry but i think you’ve got this wrong all wrong.” “but don’t you see it all fits — ” “no it doesn’t,” she said. “it doesn’t  harry you’re just getting carried away. please,” she said as he started to speak “please just answer me this if the deathly hallows really existed and dumbledore knew about them knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of death — harry why wouldn’t he have told you why?” he had his answer ready. “but you said it hermione! you’ve got to find out about them for yourself! it’s a quest!” “but i only said that to try and persuade you to come to the lovegoods’!” cried hermione in exasperation. “i didn’t really believe it!” harry took no notice. “dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. he let me try my strength take risks. this feels like the kind of thing he’d do.” “harry this isn’t a game this isn’t practice! this is the real thing and dumbledore left you very clear instructions find and destroy the horcruxes! that symbol doesn’t mean anything forget the deathly hallows we can’t afford to get sidetracked — ” harry was barely listening to her. he was turning the snitch over and over in his hands half expecting it to break open to reveal the resurrection stone to prove to hermione that he was right that the deathly hallows were real. she appealed to ron. “you don’t believe in this do you?” harry looked up. ron hesitated. “i dunno ... i mean ... bits of it sort of fit together,” said ron awkwardly. “but when you look at the whole thing ...” he took a deep breath. “i think we’re supposed to get rid of horcruxes harry. that’s what dumbledore told us to do. maybe ... maybe we should forget about this hallows business.” “thank you ron,” said hermione. “i’ll take first watch.” and she strode past harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full stop. but harry hardly slept that night. the idea of the deathly hallows had taken possession of him and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind the wand the stone and the cloak if he could just possess them all. ... i open at the close. ... but what was ‘the close’ why couldn’t he have the stone now if only he had the stone he could ask dumbledore these questions in person . . . and harry murmured words to the snitch in the darkness trying everything even parseltongue but the golden ball would not open. ... and the wand the elder wand where was that hidden where was voldemort searching now harry wished his scar would burn and show him voldemort’s thoughts because for the first time ever he and voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing. . . . hermione would not like that idea of course. ... but then she did not believe ... xenophilius had been right in a way . . . limited. narrow. close-minded. the truth was that she was scared of the idea of the deathly hallows especially of the resurrection stone ... and harry pressed his mouth again to the snitch kissing it nearly swallowing it but the cold metal did not yield. ... it was nearly dawn when he remembered luna alone in a cell in azkaban surrounded by dementors and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. he had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the hallows. if only they could rescue her but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. now he came to think about it he had not yet tried casting a patronus with the blackthorn wand. ... he must try that in the morning. . . . if only there was a way of getting a better wand . . . and desire for the elder wand the deathstick unbeatable invincible swallowed him once more. ... they packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. the downpour pursued them to the coast where they pitched the tent that night and persisted through the whole week through sodden landscapes that harry found bleak and depressing. he could think only of the deathly hallows. it was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing not hermione ’s flat disbelief nor ron’s persistent doubts could extinguish. and yet the fiercer the longing for the hallows burned inside him the less joyful it made him. he blamed ron and hermione their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits but neither could erode his certainty which remained absolute. harry’s belief in and longing for the hallows consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the horcruxes. “obsession?” said hermione in a low fierce voice when harry was careless enough to use the word one evening after hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more horcruxes. “we’re not the ones with an obsession harry! we’re the ones trying to do what dumbledore wanted us to do!” but he was impervious to the veiled criticism. dumbledore had left the sign of the hallows for hermione to decipher and he had also harry remained convinced of it left the resurrection stone hidden in the golden snitch. neither can live while the other survives. ... master of death ... why didn’t ron and hermione understand “ ‘the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’ ” harry quoted calmly. “i thought it was you-know-who we were supposed to be fighting?” hermione retorted and harry gave up on her. even the mystery of the silver doe which the other two insisted on discussing seemed less important to harry now a vaguely interesting sideshow. the only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. he sought solitude whenever it happened but was disappointed by what he saw. the visions he and voldemort were sharing had changed in quality they had become blurred shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. used to images sharp as reality harry was disconcerted by the change. he was worried that the connection between himself and voldemort had been damaged a connection that he both feared and whatever he had told hermione prized. somehow harry connected these unsatisfying vague images with the destruction of his wand as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into voldemort’s mind as well as before. as the weeks crept on harry could not help but notice even through his new self-absorption that ron seemed to be taking charge. perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them perhaps because harry’s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action. “three horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “we need a plan of action come on! where haven’t we looked let’s go through it again. the orphanage ...” diagon alley hogwarts the riddle house borgin and burkes albania every place that they knew tom riddle had ever lived or worked visited or murdered ron and hermione raked over them again harry joining in only to stop hermione pestering him. he would have been happy to sit alone in silence trying to read voldemort’s thoughts to find out more about the elder wand but ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply harry was aware to keep them moving. “you never know,” was ron’s constant refrain. “upper flagley is a wizarding village he might’ve wanted to live there. let’s go and have a poke around.” these frequent forays into wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of snatchers. “some of them are supposed to be as bad as death eaters,” said ron. “the lot that got me were a bit pathetic but bill reckons some of them are really dangerous. they said on potterwatch — ” “on what?” said harry. “ potterwatch  didn’t i tell you that’s what it was called the program i keep trying to get on the radio the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! nearly all the programs are following you-know who’s line all except potterwatch. i really want you to hear it but it’s tricky tuning in. ...” ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox and once a few bars of “a cauldron full of hot strong love.” while he tapped ron continued to try to hit on the correct password muttering strings of random words under his breath. “they’re normally something to do with the order,” he told them. “bill had a real knack for guessing them. i’m bound to get one in the end. ...” but not until march did luck favor ron at last. harry was sitting in the tent entrance on guard duty staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground when ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. “i’ve got it i’ve got it! password was altars’! get in here harry!” roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the deathly hallows harry hurried back inside the tent to find ron and hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. hermione who had been polishing the sword of gryffindor just for something to do was sitting open-mouthed staring at the tiny speaker from which a most familiar voice was issuing. ... apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming death eaters.” “but that’s lee jordan!” said hermione. “i know!” beamed ron. “cool eh?” ... now found ourselves another secure location,” lee was saying “and i’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. evening boys!” “hi.” “evening river.” “ ‘river,’ that’s lee,” ron explained. “they’ve all got code names but you can usually tell — ” “shh!” said hermione. “but before we hear from royal and romulus,” lee went on “let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the wizarding wireless network news and daily prophet don’t think important enough to mention. it is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of ted tonks and dirk cresswell.” harry felt a sick swooping in his belly. he ron and hermione gazed at one another in horror. “a goblin by the name of gornuk was also killed. it is believed that muggle-born dean thomas and a second goblin both believed to have been traveling with tonks cresswell and gornuk may have escaped. if dean is listening or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts his parents and sisters are desperate for news. “meanwhile in gaddley a muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. muggle authorities are attributing the deaths to a gas leak but members of the order of the phoenix inform me that it was the killing curse — more evidence as if it were needed of the fact that muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime. “finally we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of bathilda bagshot have been discovered in godric’s hollow. the evidence is that she died several months ago. the order of the phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by dark magic. “listeners i’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of ted tonks dirk cresswell bathilda bagshot gornuk and the unnamed but no less regretted muggles murdered by the death eaters.” silence fell and harry ron and hermione did not speak. half of harry yearned to hear more half of him was afraid of what might come next. it was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. “thank you,” said lee’s voice. “and now we turn to regular contributor royal for an update on how the new wizarding order is affecting the muggle world.” “thanks river,” said an unmistakable voice deep measured reassuring. “kingsley!” burst out ron. “we know!” said hermione hushing him. “muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,” said kingsley. “however we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect muggle friends and neighbors often without the muggles’ knowledge. i’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example perhaps by casting a protective charm over any muggle dwellings in your street. many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.” “and what would you say royal to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times it should be wizards first’?” asked lee. “i’d say that it’s one short step from wizards first’ to ‘purebloods first,’ and then to ‘death eaters,’ ” replied kingsley. “we’re all human aren’t we every human life is worth the same and worth saving.” “excellently put royal and you’ve got my vote for minister of magic if ever we get out of this mess,” said lee. “and now over to romulus for our popular feature ‘pals of potter. ’ ” “thanks river,” said another very familiar voice ron started to speak but hermione forestalled him in a whisper. “we know it’s lupin\” “romulus do you maintain as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program that harry potter is still alive?” “i do,” said lupin firmly. “there is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the death eaters if it had happened because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. the boy who lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting the triumph of good the power of innocence the need to keep resisting.” a mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in harry. had lupin forgiven him then for the terrible things he had said when they had last met “and what would you say to harry if you knew he was listening romulus?” “i’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said lupin then hesitated slightly. “and i’d tell him to follow his instincts which are good and nearly always right.” harry looked at hermione whose eyes were full of tears. “nearly always right,” she repeated. “oh didn’t i tell you?” said ron in surprise. “bill told me lupin’s living with tonks again! and apparently she’s getting pretty big too. ...” “... and our usual update on those friends of harry potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance?” lee was saying. “well as regular listeners will know several of the more outspoken supporters of harry potter have now been imprisoned including xenophilius lovegood erstwhile editor of the quibbler,” said lupin. “at least he’s still alive!” muttered ron. “we have also heard within the last few hours that rubeus hagrid” — all three of them gasped and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-known gamekeeper at hogwarts school has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of hogwarts where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘support harry potter’ party in his house. however hagrid was not taken into custody and is we believe on the run.” “i suppose it helps when escaping from death eaters if you’ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked lee. “it would tend to give you an edge,” agreed lupin gravely. “may i just add that while we here at potterwatch applaud hagrid’s spirit we would urge even the most devoted of harry’s supporters against following hagrid’s lead. ‘support harry potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.” “indeed they are romulus,” said lee “so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to potterwatcm and now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as harry potter. we like to refer to him as the chief death eater and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him i’d like to introduce a new correspondent rodent.” “ ‘rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice and harry ron and hermione cried out together “fred!” “no — is it george?” “it’s fred i think,” said ron leaning in closer as whichever twin it was said “i’m not being ‘rodent,’ no way i told you i wanted to be ‘rapier’!” “oh all right then. ‘rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the various stories we’ve been hearing about the chief death eater?” “yes river i can,” said fred. “as our listeners will know unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar you-know-who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. mind you if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine we must have a good nineteen you-know-whos running around the place.” “which suits him of course,” said kingsley. “the air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.” “agreed,” said fred. “so people let’s try and calm down a bit. things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. for instance this new idea that you know-who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. that’s a basilisk listeners. one simple test check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. if it has it’s safe to look into its eyes although if it really is you-know-who that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.” for the first time in weeks and weeks harry was laughing he could feel the weight of tension leaving him. “and the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” asked lee. “well who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in?” asked fred. “point is people don’t get lulled into a false sense of security thinking he’s out of the country. maybe he is maybe he isn’t but the fact remains he can move faster than severus snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning on taking any risks. i never thought i’d hear myself say it but safety first!” “thank you very much for those wise words rapier,” said lee. “listeners that brings us to the end of another potterwatch. we don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again but you can be sure we shall be back. keep twiddling those dials the next password will be ‘mad-eye.’ keep each other safe keep faith. good night.” the radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. harry ron and hermione were still beaming. hearing familiar friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting voldemort. it was like waking from a long sleep. “good eh?” said ron happily. “brilliant,” said harry. “it’s so brave of them,” sighed hermione admiringly. “if they were found ...” “well they keep on the move don’t they?” said ron. “like us.” “but did you hear what fred said?” asked harry excitedly now the broadcast was over his thoughts turned again toward his all-consuming obsession. “he’s abroad! he’s still looking for the wand i knew it!” “harry — ” “come on hermione why are you so determined not to admit it vol — ” “harry no!” “ — demort’s after the elder wand!” “the name’s taboo!” ron bellowed leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. “i told you harry i told you we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got to put the protection back around us — quickly — it’s how they find — ” but ron stopped talking and harry knew why. the sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer rough excited voices. ron pulled the deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it their lamps went out. “come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through the darkness. “we know you’re in there! you’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!” malfoy manor harry looked around at the other two now mere outlines in the darkness. he saw hermione point her wand not toward the outside but into his face there was a bang a burst of white light and he buckled in agony unable to see. he could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him. “get up vermin.” unknown hands dragged harry roughly off the ground. before he could stop them someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers tight swollen and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. his eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling ron and hermione outside too. “get — off — her!” ron shouted. there was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh ron grunted in pain and hermione screamed “no! leave him alone leave him alone!” “your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar rasping voice. “delicious girl ... what a treat ... i do enjoy the softness of the skin. ...” harry’s stomach turned over. he knew who this was fenrir grey back the werewolf who was permitted to wear death eater robes in return for his hired savagery. “search the tent!” said another voice. harry was thrown facedown onto the ground. a thud told him that ron had been cast down beside him. they could hear footsteps and crashes the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched. “now let’s see who we’ve got,” said greyback’s gloating voice from overhead and harry was rolled over onto his back. a beam of wandlight fell into his face and grey back laughed. “i’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. what happened to you ugly?” harry did not answer immediately. “i said,” repeated greyback and harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain “what happened to you?” “stung,” harry muttered. “been stung.” “yeah looks like it,” said a second voice. “what’s your name?” snarled greyback. “dudley,” said harry. “and your first name?” “i — vernon. vernon dudley.” “check the list scabior,” said greyback and harry heard him move sideways to look down at ron instead. “and what about you ginger?” “stan shunpike,” said ron. “like ’ell you are,” said the man called scabior. “we know stan shunpike ’e’s put a bit of work our way.” there was another thud. “i’b bardy,” said ron and harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. “bardy weadley.” “a weasley?” rasped greyback. “so you’re related to blood traitors even if you’re not a mudblood. and lastly your pretty little friend ...” the relish in his voice made harry’s flesh crawl. “easy greyback,” said scabior over the jeering of the others. “oh i’m not going to bite just yet. we’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remembering her name than barny. who are you girly?” “penelope clearwater,” said hermione. she sounded terrified but convincing. “what’s your blood status?” “half-blood,” said hermione. “easy enough to check,” said scabior. “but the ’ole lot of ’em look like they could still be ’ogwarts age — ” “weh lebt,” said ron. “left ’ave you ginger?” said scabior. “and you decided to go camping and you thought just for a laugh you’d use the dark lord’s name?” “nod a laugh,” said ron. “aggiden.” “accident?” there was more jeering laughter. “you know who used to like using the dark lord’s name weasley?” growled greyback. “the order of the phoenix. mean anything to you?” “doh.” “well they don’t show the dark lord proper respect so the name’s been tabooed. a few order members have been tracked that way. we’ll see. bind them up with the other two prisoners!” someone yanked harry up by the hair dragged him a short way pushed him down into a sitting position then started binding him back-to-back with other people. harry was still half blind barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. when at last the man tying them had walked away harry whispered to the other prisoners. “anyone still got a wand?” “no,” said ron and hermione from either side of him. “this is all my fault. i said the name i’m sorry — ” “harry?” it was a new but familiar voice and it came from directly behind harry from the person tied to hermione’s left. “dean?” “it is you! if they find out who they’ve got — ! they’re snatchers they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold — ” “not a bad little haul for one night,” greyback was saying as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. “a mudblood a runaway goblin and three truants. you checked their names on the list yet scabior?” he roared. “yeah. there’s no vernon dudley on ’ere greyback.” “interesting,” said greyback. “that’s interesting.” he crouched down beside harry who saw through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers with pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his mouth. greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where dumbledore had died of dirt sweat and blood. “so you aren’t wanted then vernon or are you on that list under a different name what house were you in at hogwarts?” “slytherin,” said harry automatically. “funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” jeered scabior out of the shadows. “but none of ’em can tell us where the common room is.” “it’s in the dungeons,” said harry clearly. “you enter through the wall. it’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake so the light’s all green.” there was a short pause. “well well looks like we really ’ave caught a little slytherin,” said scabior. “good for you vernon ’cause there ain’t a lot of mudblood slytherins. who’s your father?” “he works at the ministry,” harry lied. he knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation but on the other hand he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. “department of magical accidents and catastrophes.” “you know what greyback,” said scabior. “i think there is a dudley in there.” harry could barely breathe could luck sheer luck get them safely out of this “well well,” said greyback and harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice and knew that greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a ministry official. harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs he would not have been surprised to know that greyback could see it. “if you’re telling the truth ugly you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the ministry. i expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.” “but,” said harry his mouth bone dry “if you just let us — ” “hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “look at this greyback!” a dark figure came bustling toward them and harry saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands. they had found gryffindor’s sword. “ve-e-ry nice,” said greyback appreciatively taking it from his companion. “oh very nice indeed. looks goblin-made that. where did you get something like this?” “it’s my father’s,” harry lied hoping against hope that it was too dark for greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “we borrowed it to cut firewood — ” “ ’ang on a minute greyback! look at this in the propheti” as scabior said it harry’s scar which was stretched tight across his distended forehead burned savagely. more clearly than he could make out anything around him he saw a towering building a grim fortress jet black and forbidding voldemort’s thoughts had suddenly become razor-sharp again he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose. ... so close ...so close . . . with a huge effort of will harry closed his mind to voldemort’s thoughts pulling himself back to where he sat tied to ron hermione dean and griphook in the darkness listening to greyback and scabior. “ ‘’ermione granger,’ ” scabior was saying “ ‘the mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry potter.’ ” harry’s scar burned in the silence but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present not to slip into voldemort’s mind. he heard the creak of greyback’s boots as he crouched down in front of hermione. “you know what little girly this picture looks a hell of a lot like you.” “it isn’t! it isn’t me!” hermione ’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession. “ ‘... known to be traveling with harry potter,’ ” repeated grey back quietly. a stillness had settled over the scene. harry’s scar was exquisitely painful but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of voldemort’s thoughts it had never been so important to remain in his own right mind. “well this changes things doesn’t it?” whispered greyback. nobody spoke harry sensed the gang of snatchers watching frozen and felt hermione ’s arm trembling against his. greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where harry sat crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features. “what’s that on your forehead vernon?” he asked softly his breath foul in harry’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar. “don’t touch it!” harry yelled he could not stop himself he thought he might be sick from the pain of it. “i thought you wore glasses potter?” breathed greyback. “i found glasses!” yelped one of the snatchers skulking in the background. “there was glasses in the tent greyback wait — ” and seconds later harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto his face. the snatchers were closing in now peering at him. “it is!” rasped greyback. “we’ve caught potter!” they all took several steps backward stunned by what they had done. harry still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head could think of nothing to say fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind — — he was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — no he was harry tied up and wandless in grave danger — — looking up up to the topmost window the highest tower — he was harry and they were discussing his fate in low voices — — time to fly ... “...to the ministry?” “to hell with the ministry,” growled greyback. “they’ll take the credit and we won’t get a look in. i say we take him straight to you-know-who.” “will you summon ’im ’ere?” said scabior sounding awed terrified. “no,” snarled greyback “i haven’t got — they say he’s using the malfoys’ place as a base. we’ll take the boy there.” harry thought he knew why greyback was not calling voldemort. the werewolf might be allowed to wear death eater robes when they wanted to use him but only voldemort’s inner circle were branded with the dark mark greyback had not been granted this highest honor. harry’s scar seared again — — and he rose into the night flying straight up to the window at the very top of the tower — ... completely sure it’s him ’cause if it ain’t greyback we’re dead.” “who’s in charge here?” roared greyback covering his moment of inadequacy. “i say that’s potter and him plus his wand that’s two hundred thousand galleons right there! but if you’re too gutless to come along any of you it’s all for me and with any luck i’ll get the girl thrown in!” — the window was the merest slit in the black rock not big enough for a man to enter. ...a skeletal figure was just visible through it curled beneath a blanket. . . . dead or sleeping ...  “all right!” said scabior. “all right we’re in! and what about the rest of ’em greyback what’ll we do with ’em “might as well take the lot. we’ve got two mudbloods that’s another ten galleons. give me the sword as well. if they’re rubies that’s another small fortune right there.” the prisoners were dragged to their feet. harry could hear hermione’s breathing fast and terrified. “grab hold and make it tight. i’ll do potter!” said greyback seizing a fistful of harry’s hair harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. “on three! one — two — three — ” they disapparated pulling the prisoners with them. harry struggled trying to throw off greyback’s hand but it was hopeless ron and hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side he could not separate from the group and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still — — as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed lightly as vapor inside the cell-like room — the prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. harry’s eyes still puffy took a moment to acclimatize then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. he experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. the worst had not happened yet voldemort was not here. he was harry knew for he was fighting to resist the vision in some strange fortresslike place at the top of a tower. how long it would take voldemort to get to this place once he knew that harry was here was another matter. ... one of the snatchers strode to the gates and shook them. “how do we get in they’re locked greyback i can’t — blimey!” he whipped his hands away in fright. the iron was contorting twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face which spoke in a clanging echoing voice “state your purpose!” “we’ve got potter!” greyback roared triumphantly. “we’ve captured harry potter!” the gates swung open. “come on!” said greyback to his men and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. harry saw a ghostly white shape above him and realized it was an albino peacock. he stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by greyback now he was staggering along sideways tied back-to back to the four other prisoners. closing his puffy eyes he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment wanting to know what voldemort was doing whether he knew yet that harry was caught. ... the emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him eyes opening in a skull of a face. ... the frail man sat up great sunken eyes fixed upon him upon voldemort and then he smiled. most of his teeth were gone. ... “so you have come. i thought you would ... one day. but your journey was pointless. i never had it.” “ you lie]” as voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him harry’s scar threatened to burst with pain and he wrenched his mind back to his own body fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel. light spilled out over all of them. “what is this?” said a woman’s cold voice. “we’re here to see he-who-must-not-be-named!” rasped greyback. “who are you?” “you know me!” there was resentment in the werewolf’s voice. “fenrir greyback! we’ve caught harry potter!” greyback seized harry and dragged him around to face the light forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too. “i know ’e’s swollen ma’am but it’s ’im!” piped up scabior. “if you look a bit closer you’ll see ’is scar. and this ’ere see the girl the mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im ma’am. there’s no doubt it’s ’im and we’ve got ’is wand as well! ’ere ma’am — ” through his puffy eyelids harry saw narcissa malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. she raised her eyebrows. “bring them in,” she said. harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits. “follow me,” said narcissa leading the way across the hall. “my son draco is home for his easter holidays. if that is harry potter he will know.” the drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside even with his eyes almost closed harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. a crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling more portraits against the dark purple walls. two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the snatchers. “what is this?” the dreadfully familiar drawling voice of lucius malfoy fell on harry’s ears. he was panicking now he could see no way out and it was easier as his fear mounted to block out voldemort’s thoughts though his scar was still burning. “they say they’ve got potter,” said narcissa’s cold voice. “draco come here.” harry did not dare look directly at draco but saw him obliquely a figure slightly taller than he was rising from an armchair his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair. greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place harry directly beneath the chandelier. “well boy?” rasped the werewolf. harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame. through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving grimmauld place. his face was huge shiny and pink every feature distorted by hermione’s jinx. his black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. had he not known that it was he who stood there he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. he resolved not to speak for his voice was sure to give him away yet he still avoided eye contact with draco as the latter approached. “well draco?” said lucius malfoy. he sounded avid. “is it is it harry potter?” “i can’t — i can’t be sure,” said draco. he was keeping his distance from greyback and seemed as scared of looking at harry as harry was of looking at him. “but look at him carefully look! come closer!” harry had never heard lucius malfoy so excited. “draco if we are the ones who hand potter over to the dark lord everything will be forgiv — ” “now we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him i hope mr. malfoy?” said greyback menacingly. “of course not of course not!” said lucius impatiently. he approached harry himself came so close that harry could see the usually languid pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. with his face a puffy mask harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage. “what did you do to him?” lucius asked greyback. “how did he get into this state?” “that wasn’t us.” “looks more like a stinging jinx to me,” said lucius. his gray eyes raked harry’s forehead. “there’s something there,” he whispered “it could be the scar stretched tight. ... draco come here look properly! what do you think?” harry saw draco’s face up close now right beside his father’s. they were extraordinarily alike except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement draco’s expression was full of reluctance even fear. “i don’t know,” he said and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching. “we had better be certain lucius,” narcissa called to her husband in her cold clear voice. “completely sure that it is potter before we summon the dark lord . . . they say this is his” — she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand — “but it does not resemble ollivander’s description. ... if we are mistaken if we call the dark lord here for nothing . . . remember what he did to rowle and dolohov?” “what about the mudblood then?” growled greyback. harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again so that the light fell on hermione instead. “wait,” said narcissa sharply. “yes — yes she was in madam malkin’s with potter! i saw her picture in the prophett look draco isn’t it the granger girl?” “i ... maybe ... yeah.” “but then that’s the weasley boy!” shouted lucius striding around the bound prisoners to face ron. “it’s them potter’s friends — draco look at him isn’t it arthur weasley’s son what’s his name — ” “yeah,” said draco again his back to the prisoners. “it could be.” the drawing room door opened behind harry. a woman spoke and the sound of the voice wound harry’s fear to an even higher pitch. “what is this what’s happened cissy?” bellatrix lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners and stopped on harry’s right staring at hermione through her heavily lidded eyes. “but surely,” she said quietly “this is the mudblood girl this is granger?” “yes yes it’s granger!” cried lucius. “and beside her we think potter! potter and his friends caught at last!” “potter?” shrieked bellatrix and she backed away the better to take in harry. “are you sure well then the dark lord must be informed at once!” she dragged back her left sleeve harry saw the dark mark burned into the flesh of her arm and knew that she was about to touch it to summon her beloved master — “i was about to call him!” said lucius and his hand actually closed upon bellatrix’s wrist preventing her from touching the mark. “i shall summon him bella potter has been brought to my house and it is therefore upon my authority — ” “your authority!” she sneered attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. “you lost your authority when you lost your wand lucius! how dare you! take your hands off me!” “this is nothing to do with you you did not capture the boy — ” “begging your pardon mr. malfoy,” interjected greyback “but it’s us that caught potter and it’s us that 11 be claiming the gold — ” “gold!” laughed bellatrix still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. “take your gold filthy scavenger what do i want with gold i seek only the honor of his — of — ” she stopped struggling her dark eyes fixed upon something harry could not see. jubilant at her capitulation lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve — “stop!” shrieked bellatrix. “do not touch it we shall all perish if the dark lord comes now!” lucius froze his index finger hovering over his own mark. bellatrix strode out of harry’s limited line of vision. “what is that?” he heard her say. “sword,” grunted an out-of-sight snatcher. “give it to me.” “it’s not yorn missus it’s mine i reckon i found it.” there was a bang and a flash of red light harry knew that the snatcher had been stunned. there was a roar of anger from his fellows scabior drew his wand. “what d’you think you’re playing at woman?” “stupefyl” she screamed. “stupefyl” they were no match for her even though there were four of them against one of her she was a witch as harry knew with prodigious skill and no conscience. they fell where they stood all except greyback who had been forced into a kneeling position his arms outstretched. out of the corners of his eyes harry saw bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf the sword of gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand her face waxen. “where did you get this sword?” she whispered to greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip. “how dare you?” he snarled his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. he bared his pointed teeth. “release me woman!” “where did you find this sword?” she repeated brandishing it in his face. “snape sent it to my vault in gringotts!” “it was in their tent,” rasped greyback. “release me i say!” she waved her wand and the werewolf sprang to his feet but appeared too wary to approach her. he prowled behind an armchair his filthy curved nails clutching its back. “draco move this scum outside,” said bellatrix indicating the unconscious men. “if you haven’t got the guts to finish them then leave them in the courtyard for me.” “don’t you dare speak to draco like — ” said narcissa furiously but bellatrix screamed “be quiet! the situation is graver than you can possibly imagine cissy! we have a very serious problem!” she stood panting slightly looking down at the sword examining its hilt. then she turned to look at the silent prisoners. “if it is indeed potter he must not be harmed,” she muttered more to herself than to the others. “the dark lord wishes to dispose of potter himself. . . . but if he finds out ... i must ... i must know. ...” she turned back to her sister again. “the prisoners must be placed in the cellar while i think what to do!” “this is my house bella you don’t give orders in my “do it! you have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked bellatrix. she looked frightening mad a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet. narcissa hesitated for a moment then addressed the werewolf. “take these prisoners down to the cellar greyback.” “wait,” said bellatrix sharply. “all except ... except for the mudblood.” greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. “no!” shouted ron. “you can have me keep me!” bellatrix hit him across the face the blow echoed around the room. “if she dies under questioning i’ll take you next,” she said. “blood traitor is next to mudblood in my book. take them downstairs greyback and make sure they are secure but do nothing more to them — yet.” she threw greyback’s wand back to him then took a short silver knife from under her robes. she cut hermione free from the other prisoners then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room while greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door into a dark passageway his wand held out in front of him projecting an invisible and irresistible force. “reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s finished with her?” greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. “i’d say i’ll get a bite or two wouldn’t you ginger?” harry could feel ron shaking. they were forced down a steep flight of stairs still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. at the bottom was a heavy door. greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. the echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible drawn-out scream from directly above them. “hermione!” ron bellowed and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together so that harry staggered. “hermione!” “be quiet!” harry said. “shut up ron we need to work out a way — ” “hermione! hermione!” “we need a plan stop yelling — we need to get these ropes off — ” “harry?” came a whisper through the darkness. “ron is that you?” ron stopped shouting. there was a sound of movement close by them then harry saw a shadow moving closer. “harry ron?” “luna?” “yes it’s me! oh no i didn’t want you to be caught!” “luna can you help us get these ropes off?” said harry. “oh yes i expect so. ... there’s an old nail we use if we need to break anything. ... just a moment ...” hermione screamed again from overhead and they could hear bellatrix screaming too but her words were inaudible for ron shouted again “hermione! hermione!” “mr. ollivander?” harry could hear luna saying. “mr. ollivander have you got the nail if you just move over a little bit... i think it was beside the water jug. she was back within seconds. “you’ll need to stay still,” she said. harry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers to work the knots free. from upstairs they heard bellatrix’s voice. “i’m going to ask you again! where did you get this sword where?” “we found it — we found it — please!” hermione screamed again ron struggled harder than ever and the rusty nail slipped onto harry’s wrist. “ron please stay still!” luna whispered. “i can’t see what i’m doing — ” “my pocket!” said ron. “in my pocket there’s a deluminator and it’s full of light!” a few seconds later there was a click and the luminescent spheres the deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar unable to rejoin their sources they simply hung there like tiny suns flooding the underground room with light. harry saw luna all eyes in her white face and the motionless figure of ollivander the wandmaker curled up on the floor in the corner. craning around he caught sight of their fellow prisoners dean and griphook the goblin who seemed barely conscious kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans. “oh that’s much easier thanks ron,” said luna and she began hacking at their bindings again. “hello dean!” from above came bellatrix’s voice. “you are lying filthy mudblood and i know it! you have been inside my vault at gringotts! tell the truth tell the truth\” another terrible scream “hermione!” “what else did you take what else have you got tell me the truth or i swear i shall run you through with this knife!” “there!” harry felt the ropes fall away and turned rubbing his wrists to see ron running around the cellar looking up at the low ceiling searching for a trapdoor. dean his face bruised and bloody said “thanks” to luna and stood there shivering but griphook sank onto the cellar floor looking groggy and disoriented many welts across his swarthy face. ron was now trying to disapparate without a wand. “there’s no way out ron,” said luna watching his fruitless efforts. “the cellar is completely escape proof. i tried at first. mr. ollivander has been here for a long time he’s tried everything.” hermione was screaming again the sound went through harry like physical pain. barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar he too started to run around the cellar feeling the walls for he hardly knew what knowing in his heart that it was useless. “what else did you take what else answer me! crucio\” hermione ’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists and harry in utter desperation seized hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it he pulled out dumbledore’s snitch and shook it hoping for he did not know what — nothing happened — he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand but they were lifeless — the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor and he saw a gleam of brightest blue — dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. “help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “we’re in the cellar of malfoy manor help us!” the eye blinked and was gone. harry was not even sure that it had really been there. he tilted the shard of mirror this way and that and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison and upstairs hermione was screaming worse than ever and next to him ron was bellowing “hermione! hermione!” “how did you get into my vault?” they heard bellatrix scream. “did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?” “we only met him tonight!” hermione sobbed. “we’ve never been inside your vault. ... it isn’t the real sword! it’s a copy just a copy! “a copy?” screeched bellatrix. “oh a likely story!” “but we can find out easily!” came lucius’s voice. “draco fetch the goblin he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!” harry dashed across the cellar to where griphook was huddled on the floor. “griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear “you must tell them that sword’s a fake they mustn’t know it’s the real one griphook please — ” he could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps next moment draco’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door. “stand back. line up against the back wall. don’t try anything or i’ll kill you!” they did as they were bidden as the lock turned ron clicked the deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket restoring the cellar’s darkness. the door flew open malfoy marched inside wand held out in front of him pale and determined. he seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again dragging griphook with him. the door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. ron clicked the deluminator. three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket revealing dobby the house-elf who had just apparated into their midst. “dob — !” harry hit ron on the arm to stop him shouting and ron looked terrified at his mistake. footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead draco marching griphook to bellatrix. dobby’s enormous tennis-ball-shaped eyes were wide he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. he was back in the home of his old masters and it was clear that he was petrified. “harry potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice “dobby has come to rescue you.” “but how did you — ” an awful scream drowned harry’s words hermione was being tortured again. he cut to the essentials. “you can disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked dobby who nodded his ears flapping. “and you can take humans with you?” dobby nodded again. “right. dobby i want you to grab luna dean and mr. ollivander and take them — take them to — ” “bill and fleur’s,” said ron. “shell cottage on the outskirts of tinworth!” the elf nodded for a third time. “and then come back,” said harry. “can you do that dobby?” “of course harry potter,” whispered the little elf. he hurried over to mr. ollivander who appeared to be barely conscious. he took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own then held out the other to luna and dean neither of whom moved. “harry we want to help you!” luna whispered. “we can’t leave you here,” said dean. “go both of you! we’ll see you at bill and fleur’s.” as harry spoke his scar burned worse than ever and for a few seconds he looked down not upon the wandmaker but on another man who was just as old just as thin but laughing scornfully. “ kill me then voldemort i welcome death! but my death will not bring you what you seek. . . . there is so much you do not understand. ...” he felt voldemort’s fury but as hermione screamed again he shut it out returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present. “go!” harry beseeched luna and dean. “go! well follow just go!” they caught hold of the elf’s outstretched fingers. there was another loud crack and dobby luna dean and ollivander vanished. “what was that?” shouted lucius malfoy from over their heads. “did you hear that what was that noise in the cellar?” harry and ron stared at each other. “draco — no call wormtail! make him go and check!” footsteps crossed the room overhead then there was silence. harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. “we’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to ron. they had no choice the moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners they were lost. “leave the lights on,” harry added and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door they backed against the wall on either side of it. “stand back,” came wormtail’s voice. “stand away from the door. i am coming in.” the door flew open. for a split second wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair. then harry and ron launched themselves upon him. ron seized wormtail’s wand arm and forced it upward harry slapped a hand to his mouth muffling his voice. silently they struggled wormtail’s wand emitted sparks his silver hand closed around harry’s throat. “what is it wormtail?” called lucius malfoy from above. “nothing!” ron called back in a passable imitation of wormtail’s wheezy voice. “all fine!” harry could barely breathe. “you’re going to kill me?” harry choked attempting to prise off the metal fingers. “after i saved your life you owe me wormtail!” the silver fingers slackened. harry had not expected it he wrenched himself free astonished keeping his hand over wormtail’s mouth. he saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise he seemed just as shocked as harry at what his hand had done at the tiny merciful impulse it had betrayed and he continued to struggle more powerfully as though to undo that moment of weakness. “and well have that,” whispered ron tugging wormtail’s wand from his other hand. wandless helpless pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. his eyes had slid from harry’s face to something else. his own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat. “no — ” without pausing to think harry tried to drag back the hand but there was no stopping it. the silver tool that voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation his moment of pity he was being strangled before their eyes. “no!” ron had released wormtail too and together he and harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around wormtail’s throat but it was no use. pettigrew was turning blue. “relashiol” said ron pointing the wand at the silver hand but nothing happened pettigrew dropped to his knees and at the same moment hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. wormtail’s eyes rolled upward in his purple face he gave a last twitch and was still. harry and ron looked at each other then leaving wormtail’s body on the floor behind them ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door which was ajar. now they had a clear view of bellatrix looking down at griphook who was holding gryffindor’s sword in his long-fingered hands. hermione was lying at bellatrix’s feet. she was barely stirring. “well?” bellatrix said to griphook. “is it the true sword?” harry waited holding his breath fighting against the prickling of his scar. “no,” said griphook. “it is a fake.” “are you sure?” panted bellatrix. “quite sure?” “yes,” said the goblin. relief broke across her face all tension drained from it. “good,” she said and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblin’s face and he dropped with a yell at her feet. she kicked him aside. “and now,” she said in a voice that burst with triumph “we call the dark lord!” and she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the dark mark. at once harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again. his true surroundings vanished he was voldemort and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him he was enraged at the summons he felt — he had warned them he had told them to summon him for nothing less than potter. if they were mistaken . . . “kill me then!” demanded the old man. “you will not win you cannot win! that wand will never ever be yours — ” and voldemort’s fury broke a burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back lifeless and voldemort returned to the window his wrath barely controllable. ... they would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . . “and i think,” said bellatrix’s voice “we can dispose of the mudblood. greyback take her if you want her.” “noooooooooooo!” ron had burst into the drawing room bellatrix looked around shocked she turned her wand to face ron instead — “ expelliarmusv’ he roared pointing wormtail’s wand at bellatrix and hers flew into the air and was caught by harry who had sprinted after ron. lucius narcissa draco and greyback wheeled about harry yelled “stupefy\” and lucius malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. jets of light flew from draco’s narcissa’s and greyback’s wands harry threw himself to the floor rolling behind a sofa to avoid them. “stop or she dies!” panting harry peered around the edge of the sofa. bellatrix was supporting hermione who seemed to be unconscious and was holding her short silver knife to hermione ’s throat. “drop your wands,” she whispered. “drop them or we’ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!” ron stood rigid clutching wormtail’s wand. harry straightened up still holding bellatrix’s. “i said drop them!” she screeched pressing the blade into hermione’s throat harry saw beads of blood appear there. “all right!” he shouted and he dropped bellatrix’s wand onto the floor at his feet. ron did the same with wormtail’s. both raised their hands to shoulder height. “good!” she leered. “draco pick them up! the dark lord is coming harry potter! your death approaches!” harry knew it his scar was bursting with the pain of it and he could feel voldemort flying through the sky from far away over a dark and stormy sea and soon he would be close enough to apparate to them and harry could see no way out. “now,” said bellatrix softly as draco hurried back to her with the wands “cissy i think we ought to tie these little heroes up again while greyback takes care of miss mudblood. i am sure the dark lord will not begrudge you the girl greyback after what you have done tonight.” at the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. all of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble then with a creak and an ominous jingling it began to fall. bellatrix was directly beneath it dropping hermione she threw herself aside with a scream. the chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains falling on top of hermione and the goblin who still clutched the sword of gryffindor. glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions draco doubled over his hands covering his bloody face. as ron ran to pull hermione out of the wreckage harry took his chance he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from draco’s grip pointed all of them at greyback and yelled “stupefyl” the werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground. as narcissa dragged draco out of the way of further harm bellatrix sprang to her feet her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife but narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway. “dobby!” she screamed and even bellatrix froze. “you! you dropped the chandelier — ” the tiny elf trotted into the room his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. “you must not hurt harry potter,” he squeaked. “kill him cissy!” shrieked bellatrix but there was another loud crack and narcissa’s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. “you dirty little monkey!” bawled bellatrix. “how dare you take a witch’s wand how dare you defy your masters?” “dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “dobby is a free elf and dobby has come to save harry potter and his friends!” harry’s scar was blinding him with pain. dimly he knew that they had moments seconds before voldemort was with them. “ron catch — and go!” he yelled throwing one of the wands to him then he bent down to tug griphook out from under the chandelier. hoisting the groaning goblin who still clung to the sword over one shoulder harry seized dobby’s hand and spun on the spot to disapparate. as he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale frozen figures of narcissa and draco of the streak of red that was ron’s hair and a blur of flying silver as bellatrix’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing — bill and fleur’s . . . shell cottage . . . bill and fleur’s . . . he had disappeared into the unknown all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. the pain in his forehead pierced him and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him he could feel the blade of gryffindor’s sword bumping against his back dobby’s hand jerked in his he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge to pull them in the right direction and tried by squeezing the fingers to indicate that that was fine with him. ... and then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. harry fell to his knees relinquished dobby’s hand and attempted to lower griphook gently to the ground. “are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred but griphook merely whimpered. harry squinted around through the darkness. there seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky and he thought he saw movement outside it. “dobby is this shell cottage?” he whispered clutching the two wands he had brought from the malfoys’ ready to fight if he needed to. “have we come to the right place dobby?” he looked around. the little elf stood feet from him. “dobby!” the elf swayed slightly stars reflected in his wide shining eyes. together he and harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf’s heaving chest. “dobby — no — help!” harry bellowed toward the cottage toward the people moving there. “help!” he did not know or care whether they were wizards or muggles friends or foes all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across dobby’s front and that he had stretched out his thin arms to harry with a look of supplication. harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. “dobby no don’t die don’t die — ” the elf’s eyes found him and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. “harry ... potter ...” and then with a little shudder the elf became quite still and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see. the wandmaker it was like sinking into an old nightmare for an instant harry knelt again beside dumbledore’s body at the foot of the tallest tower at hogwarts but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass pierced by bellatrix’s silver knife. harry’s voice was still saying “dobby ... dobby ...” even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back. after a minute or so he realized that they had after all come to the right place for here were bill and fleur dean and luna gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. “hermione?” he said suddenly. “where is she?” “ron’s taken her inside,” said bill. “she’ll be all right.” harry looked back down at dobby. he stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf’s body then dragged off his own jacket and covered dobby in it like a blanket. the sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby harry listened to it while the others talked discussing matters in which he could take no interest making decisions. dean carried the injured griphook into the house fleur hurrying with them now bill was making suggestions about burying the elf. harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. as he did so he gazed down at the tiny body and his scar prickled and burned and in one part of his mind viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope he saw voldemort punishing those they had left behind at malfoy manor. his rage was dreadful and yet harry’s grief for dobby seemed to diminish it so that it became a distant storm that reached harry from across a vast silent ocean. “i want to do it properly,” were the first words of which harry was fully conscious of speaking. “not by magic. have you got a spade?” and shortly afterward he had set to work alone digging the grave in the place that bill had shown him at the end of the garden between bushes. he dug with a kind of fury relishing the manual work glorying in the non-magic of it for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. his scar burned but he was master of the pain he felt it yet was apart from it. he had learned control at last learned to shut his mind to voldemort the very thing dumbledore had wanted him to learn from snape. just as voldemort had not been able to possess harry while harry was consumed with grief for sirius so his thoughts could not penetrate harry now while he mourned dobby. grief it seemed drove voldemort out ... though dumbledore of course would have said that it was love. ... on harry dug deeper and deeper into the hard cold earth subsuming his grief in sweat denying the pain in his scar. in the darkness with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company the things that had happened at the malfoys’ returned to him the things he had heard came back to him and understanding blossomed in the darkness. ... the steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. hallows ... horcruxes ... hallows ... horcruxes ... yet he no longer burned with that weird obsessive longing. loss and fear had snuffed it out he felt as though he had been slapped awake again. deeper and deeper harry sank into the grave and he knew where voldemort had been tonight and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of nurmengard and why. ... and he thought of wormtail dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy. . . . dumbledore had foreseen that. ... how much more had he known harry lost track of time. he knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by ron and dean. “how’s hermione?” “better,” said ron. “fleur’s looking after her.” harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand but he did not need it. they jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks which he placed upon the elf’s bare feet. dean produced a woolen hat which harry placed carefully upon dobby’s head muffling his batlike ears. “we should close his eyes.” harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. bill was wearing a traveling cloak fleur a large white apron from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what harry recognized to be skele-gro. hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown pale and unsteady on her feet ron put an arm around her when she reached him. luna who was huddled in one of fleur’s coats crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf’s eyelids sliding them over his glassy stare. “there,” she said softly. “now he could be sleeping.” harry placed the elf into the grave arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. he forced himself not to break down as he remembered dumbledore’s funeral and the rows and rows of golden chairs and the minister of magic in the front row the recitation of dumbledore’s achievements the stateliness of the white marble tomb. he felt that dobby deserved just as grand a funeral and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “i think we ought to say something,” piped up luna. “i’ll go first shall i?” and as everybody looked at her she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “thank you so much dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. it’s so unfair that you had to die when you were so good and brave. i’ll always remember what you did for us. i hope you’re happy now.” she turned and looked expectantly at ron who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice “yeah ... thanks dobby.” “thanks,” muttered dean. harry swallowed. “good-bye dobby,” he said. it was all he could manage but luna had said it all for him. bill raised his wand and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it a small reddish mound. “d’you mind if i stay here a moment?” he asked the others. they murmured words he did not catch he felt gentle pats upon his back and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage leaving harry alone beside the elf. he looked around there were a number of large white stones smoothed by the sea marking the edge of the flower beds. he picked up one of the largest and laid it pillowlike over the place where dobby ’s head now rested. he then felt in his pocket for a wand. there were two in there. he had forgotten lost track he could not now remember whose wands these were he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. he selected the shorter of the two which felt friendlier in his hand and pointed it at the rock. slowly under his murmured instruction deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. he knew that hermione could have done it more neatly and probably more quickly but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. when harry stood up again the stone read here lies dobby a free elf. he looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds then walked away his scar still prickling a little and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave ideas that had taken shape in the darkness ideas both fascinating and terrible. they were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall their attention focused upon bill who was talking. the room was light-colored pretty with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet so he stood in the doorway listening. ... lucky that ginny’s on holiday. if she’d been at hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her. now we know she’s safe too.” he looked around and saw harry standing there. “i’ve been getting them all out of the burrow,” he explained. “moved them to muriel’s. the death eaters know ron’s with you now they’re bound to target the family — don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of harry’s expression. “it was always a matter of time dad’s been saying so for months. we’re the biggest blood-traitor family there is.” “how are they protected?” asked harry. “fidelius charm. dad’s secret-keeper. and we’ve done it on this cottage too i’m secret-keeper here. none of us can go to work but that’s hardly the most important thing now. once ollivander and griphook are well enough we’ll move them to muriel’s too. there isn’t much room here but she’s got plenty. griphook’s legs are on the mend fleur’s given him skele-gro we could probably move them in an hour or — “no,” harry said and bill looked startled. “i need both of them here. i need to talk to them. it’s important.” he heard the authority in his own voice the conviction the sense of purpose that had come to him as he dug dobby’s grave. all of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled. “i’m going to wash,” harry told bill looking down at his hands still covered in mud and dobby’s blood. “then 111 need to see them straightaway.” he walked into the little kitchen to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. dawn was breaking over the horizon shell pink and faintly gold as he washed again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden. ... dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar but harry knew what he had seen. a piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment and then help had come. help will always be given at hog warts to those who ask for it harry dried his hands impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. he looked out over the ocean and felt closer this dawn than ever before closer to the heart of it all. and still his scar prickled and he knew that voldemort was getting there too. harry understood and yet did not understand. his instinct was telling him one thing his brain quite another. the dumbledore in harry’s head smiled surveying harry over the tips of his fingers pressed together as if in prayer. you gave ron the deluminator. you understood him. . . . you gave him a way back. . . . and you understood wormtail too. ... you knew there was a bit of regret there somewhere. ... and if you knew them ... what did you know about me dumbledore am i meant to know but not to seek did you know how hard i’d find that is that why you made it this difficult so i’d have time to work that out harry stood quite still eyes glazed watching the place where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. he set it down and returned to the hall and as he did so he felt his scar pulse angrily and there flashed across his mind swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water the outline of a building he knew extremely well. bill and fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. “i need to speak to griphook and ollivander,” harry said. “no,” said fleur. “you will ’ave to wait ’arry. zey are both ill tired — ” “i’m sorry,” he said without heat “but it can’t wait. i need to talk to them now. privately — and separately. it’s urgent.” “harry what the hell’s going on?” asked bill. “you turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half conscious goblin hermione looks as though she’s been tortured and ron’s just refused to tell me anything — ” “we can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said harry flatly. “you’re in the order bill you know dumbledore left us a mission. we’re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.” fleur made an impatient noise but bill did not look at her he was staring at harry. his deeply scarred face was hard to read. finally bill said “all right. who do you want to talk to first?” harry hesitated. he knew what hung on his decision. there was hardly any time left now was the moment to decide horcruxes or hallows “griphook,” harry said. “i’ll speak to griphook first.” his heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle. “up here then,” said bill leading the way. harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. “i need you two as well!” he called to ron and hermione who had been skulking half concealed in the doorway of the sitting room. they both moved into the light looking oddly relieved. “how are you?” harry asked hermione. “you were amazing — coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that — ” hermione gave a weak smile as ron gave her a one armed squeeze. “what are we doing now harry?” he asked. “you’ll see. come on.” harry ron and hermione followed bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. three doors led off it. “in here,” said bill opening the door into his and fleur’s room. it too had a view of the sea now flecked with gold in the sunrise. harry moved to the window turned his back on the spectacular view and waited his arms folded his scar prickling. hermione took the chair beside the dressing table ron sat on the arm. bill reappeared carrying the little goblin whom he set down carefully upon the bed. griphook grunted thanks and bill left closing the door upon them all. “i’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said harry. “how are your legs?” “painful,” replied the goblin. “but mending.” he was still clutching the sword of gryffindor and wore a strange look half truculent half intrigued. harry noted the goblin’s sallow skin his long thin fingers his black eyes. fleur had removed his shoes his long feet were dirty. he was larger than a house elf but not by much. his domed head was much bigger than a human’s. “you probably don’t remember — ” harry began. “ — that i was the goblin who showed you to your vault the first time you ever visited gringotts?” said griphook. “i remember harry potter. even amongst goblins you are very famous.” harry and the goblin looked at each other sizing each other up. harry’s scar was still prickling. he wanted to get through this interview with griphook quickly and at the same time was afraid of making a false move. while he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request the goblin broke the silence. “you buried the elf,” he said sounding unexpectedly rancorous. “i watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.” “yes,” said harry. griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes. “you are an unusual wizard harry potter.” “in what way?” asked harry rubbing his scar absently. “you dug the grave.” “so?” griphook did not answer. harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a muggle but it did not much matter to him whether griphook approved of dobby’s grave or not. he gathered himself for the attack. “griphook i need to ask — ” “you also rescued a goblin.” “what?” “you brought me here. saved me.” “well i take it you’re not sorry?” said harry a little impatiently. “no harry potter,” said griphook and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin “but you are a very odd wizard.” “right,” said harry. “well i need some help griphook and you can give it to me.” the goblin made no sign of encouragement but continued to frown at harry as though he had never seen anything like him. “i need to break into a gringotts vault.” harry had not meant to say it so baldly the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw again the outline of hogwarts. he closed his mind firmly. he needed to deal with griphook first. ron and hermione were staring at harry as though he had gone mad. “harry — ” said hermione but she was cut off by griphook. “break into a gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. “it is impossible.” “no it isn’t,” ron contradicted him. “it’s been done.” “yeah,” said harry. “the same day i first met you griphook. my birthday seven years ago.” “the vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the goblin and harry understood that even though griphook had left gringotts he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached. “its protection was minimal.” “well the vault we need to get into isn’t empty and i’m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful,” said harry. “it belongs to the lestranges.” he saw hermione and ron look at each other astonished but there would be time enough to explain after griphook had given his answer. “you have no chance,” said griphook flatly. “no chance at all. if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours — ” “thief you have been warned beware — yeah i know i remember,” said harry. “but i’m not trying to get myself any treasure i’m not trying to take anything for personal gain. can you believe that?” the goblin looked slantwise at harry and the lightning scar on harry’s forehead prickled but he ignored it refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. “if there was a wizard of whom i would believe that they did not seek personal gain,” said griphook finally “it would be you harry potter. goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. not from wand carriers.” “wand-carriers,” repeated harry the phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled as voldemort turned his thoughts northward and as harry burned to question ollivander next door. “the right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly “has long been contested between wizards and goblins.” “well goblins can do magic without wands,” said ron. “that is immaterial! wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!” “well goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said ron. “you won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never — ” “it doesn’t matter,” said harry noting griphook’s rising color. “this isn’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature — ” griphook gave a nasty laugh. “but it is it is about precisely that! as the dark lord becomes ever more powerful your race is set still more firmly above mine! gringotts falls under wizarding rule house-elves are slaughtered and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?” “we do!” said hermione. she had sat up straight her eyes bright. “we protest! and i’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf griphook! i’m a mudblood!” “don’t call yourself — ” ron muttered. “why shouldn’t i?” said hermione. “mudblood and proud of it! i’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have griphook! it was me they chose to torture back at the malfoys’!” as she spoke she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut bellatrix had made scarlet against her throat. “did you know that it was harry who set dobby free?” she asked. “did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of hermione’s chair. “you can’t want you know-who defeated more than we do griphook!” the goblin gazed at hermione with the same curiosity he had shown harry. “what do you seek within the lestranges’ vault?” he asked abruptly. “the sword that lies inside it is a fake. this is the real one.” he looked from one to the other of them. “i think that you already know this. you asked me to lie for you back there.” “but the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault is it?” asked harry. “perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there?” his heart was pounding harder than ever. he redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar. the goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. “it is against our code to speak of the secrets of gringotts. we are the guardians of fabulous treasures. we have a duty to the objects placed in our care which were so often wrought by our fingers.” the goblin stroked the sword and his black eyes roved from harry to hermione to ron and then back again. “so young,” he said finally “to be fighting so many.” “will you help us?” said harry. “we haven’t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin’s help. you’re our one chance.” “i shall ... think about it,” said griphook maddeningly. “but — ” ron started angrily hermione nudged him in the ribs. “thank you,” said harry. the goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement then flexed his short legs. “i think,” he said settling himself ostentatiously upon bill and fleur’s bed “that the skele-gro has finished its work. i may be able to sleep at last. forgive me. ...” “yeah of course,” said harry but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of gryffindor from beside the goblin. griphook did not protest but harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him. “little git,” whispered ron. “he’s enjoying keeping us hanging.” “harry,” whispered hermione pulling them both away from the door into the middle of the still-dark landing “are you saying what i think you’re saying are you saying there’s a horcrux in the lestranges’ vault?” “yes,” said harry. “bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been in there she was beside herself. why what did she think we’d seen what else did she think we might have taken something she was petrified you-know-who would find out about.” “but i thought we were looking for places you-know who’s been places he’s done something important?” said ron looking baffled. “was he ever inside the lestranges’ vault?” “i don’t know whether he was ever inside gringotts,” said harry. “he never had gold there when he was younger because nobody left him anything. he would have seen the bank from the outside though the first time he ever went to diagon alley.” harry’s scar throbbed but he ignored it he wanted ron and hermione to understand about gringotts before they spoke to ollivander. “i think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a gringotts vault. i think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the wizarding world. and don’t forget he trusted bellatrix and her husband. they were his most devoted servants before he fell and they went looking for him after he vanished. he said it the night he came back i heard him.” harry rubbed his scar. “i don’t think he’d have told bellatrix it was a horcrux though. he never told lucius malfoy the truth about the diary. he probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. the safest place in the world for anything you want to hide hagrid told me ... except for hogwarts.” when harry had finished speaking ron shook his head. “you really understand him.” “bits of him,” said harry. “bits ... i just wish i’d understood dumbledore as much. but well see. come on — ollivander now.” ron and hermione looked bewildered but impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite bill and fleur’s. a weak “come in!” answered them. the wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. he had been held in the cellar for more than a year and tortured harry knew on at least one occasion. he was emaciated the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. his great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. the hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. harry sat down on the empty bed beside ron and hermione. the rising sun was not visible here. the room faced the cliff top garden and the freshly dug grave. “mr. ollivander i’m sorry to disturb you,” harry said. “my dear boy.” ollivander’s voice was feeble. “you rescued us. i thought we would die in that place. i can never thank you ... never thank you ... enough.” “we were glad to do it.” harry’s scar throbbed. he knew he was certain that there was hardly any time left in which to beat voldemort to his goal or else to attempt to thwart him. he felt a flutter of panic ... yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to griphook first. feigning a calm he did not feel he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand. “mr. ollivander i need some help.” “anything. anything,” said the wandmaker weakly. “can you mend this is it possible?” ollivander held out a trembling hand and harry placed the two barely connected halves into his palm. “holly and phoenix feather,” said ollivander in a tremulous voice. “eleven inches. nice and supple.” “yes,” said harry. “can you — ” “no,” whispered ollivander. “i am sorry very sorry but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that i know of.” harry had been braced to hear it but it was a blow nevertheless. he took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished and did not look away until harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the malfoys’. “can you identify these?” harry asked. the wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers flexing it slightly. “walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. “twelve and-three-quarter inches. unyielding. this wand belonged to bellatrix lestrange.” “and this one?” ollivander performed the same examination. “hawthorn and unicorn hair. ten inches precisely. reasonably springy. this was the wand of draco malfoy.” “was?” repeated harry. “isn’t it still his?” “perhaps not. if you took it — ” “— i did — ” “ — then it may be yours. of course the manner of taking matters. much also depends upon the wand itself. in general however where a wand has been won its allegiance will change.” there was silence in the room except for the distant rushing of the sea. “you talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said harry “like they can think for themselves.” “the wand chooses the wizard,” said ollivander. “that much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.” “a person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them though?” asked harry. “oh yes if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. the best results however must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. these connections are complex. an initial attraction and then a mutual quest for experience the wand learning from the wizard the wizard from the wand.” the sea gushed forward and backward it was a mournful sound. “i took this wand from draco malfoy by force,” said harry. “can i use it safely?” “i think so. subtle laws govern wand ownership but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.” “so i should use this one?” said ron pulling wormtail’s wand out of his pocket and handing it to ollivander. “chestnut and dragon heartstring. nine-and-a quarter inches. brittle. i was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping for peter pettigrew. yes if you won it it is more likely to do your bidding and do it well than another wand.” “and this holds true for all wands does it?” asked harry. “i think so,” replied ollivander his protuberant eyes upon harry’s face. “you ask deep questions mr. potter. wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.” “so it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession of a wand?” asked harry. ollivander swallowed. “necessary no i should not say that it is necessary to kill.” “there are legends though,” said harry and as his heart rate quickened the pain in his scar became more intense he was sure that voldemort had decided to put his idea into action. “legends about a wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to hand by murder.” ollivander turned pale. against the snowy pillow he was light gray and his eyes were enormous bloodshot and bulging with what looked like fear. “only one wand i think,” he whispered. “and you-know-who is interested in it isn’t he?” asked harry. “i — how?” croaked ollivander and he looked appealingly at ron and hermione for help. “how do you know this?” “he wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,” said harry. ollivander looked terrified. “he tortured me you must understand that! the cruciatus curse i — i had no choice but to tell him what i knew what i guessed!” “i understand,” said harry. “you told him about the twin cores you said he just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?” ollivander looked horrified transfixed by the amount that harry knew. he nodded slowly. “but it didn’t work,” harry went on. “mine still beat the borrowed wand. do you know why that is?” ollivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded. “i had ... never heard of such a thing. your wand performed something unique that night. the connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare yet why your wand should have snapped the borrowed wand i do not know. ...” “we were talking about the other wand the wand that changes hands by murder. when you-know-who realized my wand had done something strange he came back and asked about that other wand didn’t he?” “how do you know this?” harry did not answer. “yes he asked,” whispered ollivander. “he wanted to know everything i could tell him about the wand variously known as the deathstick the wand of destiny or the elder wand.” harry glanced sideways at hermione. she looked flabbergasted. “the dark lord,” said ollivander in hushed and frightened tones “had always been happy with the wand i made him — yew and phoenix feather thirteen-and-a-half inches — until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. now he seeks another more powerful wand as the only way to conquer yours.” “but he’ll know soon if he doesn’t already that mine’s broken beyond repair,” said harry quietly. “no!” said hermione sounding frightened. “he can’t know that harry how could he — ” “priori incantatem,” said harry. “we left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the malfoys’ hermione. if they examine them properly make them re-create the spells they’ve cast lately they’ll see that yours broke mine they’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it and they’ll realize that i’ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.” the little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. ron gave harry a reproachful look and said “let’s not worry about that now — ” but mr. ollivander intervened. “the dark lord no longer seeks the elder wand only for your destruction mr. potter. he is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.” “and will it?” “the owner of the elder wand must always fear attack,” said ollivander “but the idea of the dark lord in possession of the deathstick is i must admit ... formidable.” harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure when they first met of how much he liked ollivander. even now having been tortured and imprisoned by voldemort the idea of the dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him. “you — you really think this wand exists then mr. ollivander?” asked hermione. “oh yes,” said ollivander. “yes it is perfectly possible to trace the wand’s course through history. there are gaps of course and long ones where it vanishes from view temporarily lost or hidden but always it resurfaces. it has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. there are written accounts some of them obscure that i and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. they have the ring of authenticity.” “so you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?” hermione asked hopefully. “no,” said ollivander. “whether it needs to pass by murder i do not know. its history is bloody but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object and arouses such passions in wizards. immensely powerful dangerous in the wrong hands and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.” “mr. ollivander,” said harry “you told you-know-who that gregorovitch had the elder wand didn’t you?” ollivander turned if possible even paler. he looked ghostly as he gulped. “but how — how do you — ” “never mind how i know it,” said harry closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw for mere seconds a vision of the main street in hogsmeade still dark because it was so much farther north. “you told you-know-who that gregorovitch had the wand?” “it was a rumor,” whispered ollivander. “a rumor years and years ago long before you were born! i believe gregorovitch himself started it. you can see how good it would be for business that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the elder wand!” “yes i can see that,” said harry. he stood up. “mr. ollivander one last thing and then we’ll let you get some rest. what do you know about the deathly hallows?” “the — the what?” asked the wandmaker looking utterly bewildered. “the deathly hallows.” “i’m afraid i don’t know what you’re talking about. is this still something to do with wands?” harry looked into the sunken face and believed that ollivander was not acting. he did not know about the hallows. “thank you,” said harry. “thank you very much. we’ll leave you to get some rest now.” ollivander looked stricken. “he was torturing me!” he gasped. “the cruciatus curse ... you have no idea. ...” “i do,” said harry. “i really do. please get some rest. thank you for telling me all of this.” he led ron and hermione down the staircase. harry caught a glimpse of bill fleur luna and dean sitting at the table in the kitchen cups of tea in front of them. they all looked up at harry as he appeared in the doorway but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden ron and hermione behind him. the reddish mound of earth that covered dobby lay ahead and harry walked back to it as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. it was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. he would yield very soon because he needed to know that his theory was right. he must make only one more short effort so that he could explain to ron and hermione. “gregorovitch had the elder wand a long time ago,” he said. “i saw you-know-who trying to find him. when he tracked him down he found that gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore it was stolen from him by grindelwald. how grindelwald found out that gregorovitch had it i don’t know — but if gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor it can’t have been that difficult.” voldemort was at the gates of hogwarts harry could see him standing there and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn coming closer and closer. “and grindelwald used the elder wand to become powerful. and at the height of his power when dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him he dueled grindelwald and beat him and he took the elder wand.” “dumbledore had the elder wand?” said ron. “but then — where is it now?” “at hogwarts,” said harry fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden. “but then let’s go!” said ron urgently. “harry let’s go and get it before he does!” “it’s too late for that,” said harry. he could not help himself but clutched his head trying to help it resist. “he knows where it is. he’s there now.” “harry!” ron said furiously. “how long have you known this — why have we been wasting time why did you talk to griphook first we could have gone — we could still go — ” “no,” said harry and he sank to his knees in the grass. “hermione’s right. dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. he didn’t want me to take it. he wanted me to get the horcruxes.” “the unbeatable wand harry!” moaned ron. “i’m not supposed to ... i’m supposed to get the horcruxes. ...” and now everything was cool and dark the sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside snape up through the grounds toward the lake. “i shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high cold voice. “leave me now.” snape bowed and set off back up the path his black cloak billowing behind him. harry walked slowly waiting for snape ’s figure to disappear. it would not do for snape or indeed anyone else to see where he was going. but there were no lights in the castle windows and he could conceal himself ... and in a second he had cast upon himself a disillusionment charm that hid him even from his own eyes. and he walked on around the edge of the lake taking in the outlines of the beloved castle his first kingdom his birthright. ... and here it was beside the lake reflected in the dark waters. the white marble tomb an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. he felt again that rush of controlled euphoria that heady sense of purpose in destruction. he raised the old yew wand how fitting that this would be its last great act. the tomb split open from head to foot. the shrouded figure was as long and thin as it had been in life. he raised the wand again. the wrappings fell open. the face was translucent pale sunken yet almost perfectly preserved. they had left his spectacles on the crooked nose he felt amused derision. dumbledore’s hands were folded upon his chest and there it lay clutched beneath them buried with him. had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand had he thought that the dark lord would be scared to violate his tomb the spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from dumbledore’s grasp and as he took it a shower of sparks flew from its tip sparkling over the corpse of its last owner ready to serve a new master at last. shell cottage bill and fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. it was a lonely and beautiful place. wherever harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea like the breathing of some great slumbering creature. he spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide empty sea and the feel of cold salty wind on his face. the enormity of his decision not to race voldemort to the wand still scared harry. he could not remember ever before choosing not to act. he was full of doubts doubts that ron could not help voicing whenever they were together. “what if dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?” “what if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the hallows?” “harry if that really is the elder wand how the hell are we supposed to finish off you-know who?” harry had no answers there were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent voldemort breaking open the tomb. he could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision they sounded feebler to him. the odd thing was that hermione’s support made him feel just as confused as ron’s doubts. now forced to accept that the elder wand was real she maintained that it was an evil object and that the way voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent not to be considered. “you could never have done that harry,” she said again and again. “you couldn’t have broken into dumbledore’s grave.” but the idea of dumbledore’s corpse frightened harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living dumbledore’s intentions. he felt that he was still groping in the dark he had chosen his path but kept looking back wondering whether he had misread the signs whether he should not have taken the other way. from time to time anger at dumbledore crashed over him again powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage anger that dumbledore had not explained before he died. “but is he dead?” said ron three days after they had arrived at the cottage. harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when ron and hermione had found him he wished they had not having no wish to join in with their argument. “yes he is ron please don’t start that again!” “look at the facts hermione,” said ron speaking across harry who continued to gaze at the horizon. “the silver doe. the sword. the eye harry saw in the mirror — ” “harry admits he could have imagined the eye! don’t you harry?” “i could have,” said harry without looking at her. “but you don’t think you did do you?” asked ron. “no i don’t,” said harry. “there you go!” said ron quickly before hermione could carry on. “if it wasn’t dumbledore explain how dobby knew we were in the cellar hermione?” “i can’t — but can you explain how dumbledore sent him to us if he’s lying in a tomb at hogwarts?” “i dunno it could’ve been his ghost!” “dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said harry. there was little about dumbledore he was sure of now but he knew that much. “he would have gone on.” “what d’you mean ‘gone on’?” asked ron but before harry could say any more a voice behind them said “ ’arry?” fleur had come out of the cottage her long silver hair flying in the breeze. “ ’arry grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’e eez in ze smallest bedroom ’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.” her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear she looked irritable as she walked back around the house. griphook was waiting for them as fleur had said in the tiniest of the cottage’s three bedrooms in which hermione and luna slept by night. he had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright cloudy sky which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy light cottage. “i have reached my decision harry potter,” said the goblin who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. “though the goblins of gringotts will consider it base treachery i have decided to help you — ” “that’s great!” said harry relief surging through him. “griphook thank you we’re really — ” “ — in return,” said the goblin firmly “for payment.” slightly taken aback harry hesitated. “how much do you want i’ve got gold.” “not gold,” said griphook. “i have gold.” his black eyes glittered there were no whites to his eyes. “i want the sword. the sword of godric gryffindor.” harry’s spirits plummeted. “you can’t have that,” he said. “i’m sorry.” “then,” said the goblin softly “we have a problem.” “we can give you something else,” said ron eagerly. “i’ll bet the lestranges have got loads of stuff you can take your pick once we get into the vault.” he had said the wrong thing. griphook flushed angrily. “i am not a thief boy! i am not trying to procure treasures to which i have no right!” “the sword’s ours — ” “it is not,” said the goblin. “we’re gryffindors and it was godric gryffindor’s — ” “and before it was gryffindor’s whose was it?” demanded the goblin sitting up straight. “no one’s,” said ron. “it was made for him wasn’t it?” “no!” cried the goblin bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at ron. “wizarding arrogance again! that sword was ragnuk the first’s taken from him by godric gryffindor! it is a lost treasure a masterpiece of goblinwork! it belongs with the goblins! the sword is the price of my hire take it or leave it!” griphook glared at them. harry glanced at the other two then said “we need to discuss this griphook if that’s all right. could you give us a few minutes?” the goblin nodded looking sour. downstairs in the empty sitting room harry walked to the fireplace brow furrowed trying to think what to do. behind him ron said “he’s having a laugh. we can’t let him have that sword.” “it is true?” harry asked hermione. “was the sword stolen by gryffindor?” “i don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races but there’s no account that i know of that says gryffindor stole the sword.” “it’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said ron “about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. i suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.” “goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards ron,” said hermione. “they’ve been treated brutally in the past.” “goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies though are they?” said ron. “they’ve killed plenty of us. they’ve fought dirty too.” “but arguing with griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us is it?” there was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. harry looked out of the window at dobby’s grave. luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. “okay,” said ron and harry turned back to face him “how’s this we tell griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it. there’s a fake in there isn’t there we switch them and give him the fake.” “ron he’d know the difference better than we would!” said hermione. “he’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!” “yeah but we could scarper before he realizes — ” he quailed beneath the look hermione was giving him. “that,” she said quietly “is despicable. ask for his help then double-cross him and you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards ron?” ron’s ears had turned red. “all right all right! it was the only thing i could think of! what’s your solution then?” “we need to offer him something else something just as valuable.” “brilliant. i’ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.” silence fell between them again. harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword even if they had something as valuable to offer him. yet the sword was their one indispensable weapon against the horcruxes. he closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. the idea that gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him he had always been proud to be a gryffindor gryffindor had been the champion of muggle-borns the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving slytherin. ... “maybe he’s lying,” harry said opening his eyes again. “griphook. maybe gryffindor didn’t take the sword. how do we know the goblin version of history’s right?” “does it make a difference?” asked hermione. “changes how i feel about it,” said harry. he took a deep breath. “well tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get into that vault — but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it.” a grin spread slowly across ron’s face. hermione however looked alarmed. “harry we can’t — ” “he can have it,” harry went on “after we’ve used it on all of the horcruxes. i’ll make sure he gets it then. i’ll keep my word.” “but that could be years!” said hermione. “i know that but he needn’t. i won’t be lying ... really.” harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. he remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to nurmengard for the greater good. he pushed the idea away. what choice did they have “i don’t like it,” said hermione. “nor do i much,” harry admitted. “well i think it’s genius,” said ron standing up again. “let’s go and tell him.” back in the smallest bedroom harry made the offer careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking he felt irritated at her afraid that she might give the game away. however griphook had eyes for nobody but harry. “i have your word harry potter that you will give me the sword of gryffindor if i help you?” “yes,” said harry. “then shake,” said the goblin holding out his hand. harry took it and shook. he wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. then griphook relinquished him clapped his hands together and said “so. we begin!” it was like planning to break into the ministry all over again. they settled to work in the smallest bedroom which was kept according to griphook’s preference in semidarkness. “i have visited the lestranges’ vault only once,” griphook told them “on the occasion i was told to place inside it the false sword. it is one of the most ancient chambers. the oldest wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level where the vaults are largest and best protected. ...” they remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. slowly the days stretched into weeks. there was problem after problem to overcome not least of which was that their store of polyjuice potion was greatly depleted. “there’s really only enough left for one of us,” said hermione tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight. “that’ll be enough,” said harry who was examining griphook’s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways. the other inhabitants of shell cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that harry ron and hermione only emerged for mealtimes. nobody asked questions although harry often felt bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table thoughtful concerned. the longer they spent together the more harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the lestranges’ vault. harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two but they did not discuss it they needed griphook. the goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. even after his legs had mended he continued to request trays of food in his room like the still-frail ollivander until bill following an angry outburst from fleur went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. thereafter griphook joined them at the overcrowded table although he refused to eat the same food insisting instead on lumps of raw meat roots and various fungi. harry felt responsible it was after all he who had insisted that the goblin remain at shell cottage so that he could question him his fault that the whole weasley family had been driven into hiding that bill fred george and mr. weasley could no longer work. “i’m sorry,” he told fleur one blustery april evening as he helped her prepare dinner. “i never meant you to have to deal with all of this.” she had just set some knives to work chopping up steaks for griphook and bill who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by greyback. while the knives sliced away behind her her somewhat irritable expression softened. “ ’arry you saved my sister’s life i do not forget.” this was not strictly speaking true but harry decided against reminding her that gabrielle had never been in real danger. “anyway,” fleur went on pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the stove which began to bubble at once “mr. ollivander leaves for muriel’s zis evening. zat will make zings easier. ze goblin,” she scowled a little at the mention of him “can move downstairs and you ron and dean can take zat room.” “we don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said harry who knew that griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa keeping griphook happy was essential to their plans. “don’t worry about us.” and when she tried to protest he went on “we’ll be off your hands soon too ron hermione and i. we won’t need to be here much longer.” “but what do you mean?” she said frowning at him her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “of course you must not leave you are safe ’ere!” she looked rather like mrs. weasley as she said it and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment. luna and dean entered their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood. ... and tiny little ears,” luna was saying “a bit like a hippo’s daddy says only purple and hairy. and if you want to call them you have to hum they prefer a waltz nothing too fast. ...” looking uncomfortable dean shrugged at harry as he passed following luna into the combined dining and sitting room where ron and hermione were laying the dinner table. seizing the chance to escape fleur’s questions harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them. ... and if you ever come to our house i’ll be able to show you the horn daddy wrote to me about it but i haven’t seen it yet because the death eaters took me from the hogwarts express and i never got home for christmas,” luna was saying as she and dean relaid the fire. “luna we told you,” hermione called over to her. “that horn exploded. it came from an erumpent not a crumple-horned snorkack — ” “no it was definitely a snorkack horn,” said luna serenely. “daddy told me. it will probably have re formed by now they mend themselves you know.” hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as bill appeared leading mr. ollivander down the stairs. the wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail and he clung to bill’s arm as the latter supported him carrying a large suitcase. ‘tm going to miss you mr. ollivander,” said luna approaching the old man. “and i you my dear,” said ollivander patting her on the shoulder. “you were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.” “so au revoir mr. ollivander,” said fleur kissing him on both cheeks. “and i wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to bill’s auntie muriel i never returned ’er tiara.” “it will be an honor,” said ollivander with a little bow “the very least i can do in return for your generous hospitality.” fleur drew out a worn velvet case which she opened to show the wandmaker. the tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. “moonstones and diamonds,” said griphook who had sidled into the room without harry noticing. “made by goblins i think?” “and paid for by wizards,” said bill quietly and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging. a strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as bill and ollivander set off into the night. the rest of them squeezed in around the table elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move they started to eat. the fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. fleur harry noticed was merely playing with her food she glanced at the window every few minutes however bill returned before they had finished their first course his long hair tangled by the wind. “everything’s fine,” he told fleur. “ollivander settled in mum and dad say hello. ginny sends you all her love. fred and george are driving muriel up the wall they’re still operating an owl-order business out of her back room. it cheered her up to have her tiara back though. she said she thought we’d stolen it.” “ah she eez charmante your aunt,” said fleur crossly waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. she caught them and marched out of the room. “daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up luna. “well more of a crown really.” ron caught harry’s eye and grinned harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to xenophilius. “yes he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of ravenclaw. he thinks he’s identified most of the main elements now. adding the billywig wings really made a difference — ” there was a bang on the front door. everyone’s head turned toward it. fleur came running out of the kitchen looking frightened bill jumped to his feet his wand pointing at the door harry ron and hermione did the same. silently griphook slipped beneath the table out of sight. “who is it?” bill called. “it is i remus john lupin!” called a voice over the howling wind. harry experienced a thrill of fear what had happened “i am a werewolf married to nymphadora tonks and you the secret-keeper of shell cottage told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!” “lupin,” muttered bill and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. lupin fell over the threshold. he was white-faced wrapped in a traveling cloak his graying hair windswept. he straightened up looked around the room making sure of who was there then cried aloud “it’s a boy! we’ve named him ted after dora’s father!” hermione shrieked. “wha —  tonks — tonks has had the baby?” “yes yes she’s had the baby!” shouted lupin. all around the table came cries of delight sighs of relief hermione and fleur both squealed “congratulations!” and ron said “blimey a baby!” as if he had never heard of such a thing before. “yes — yes — a boy,” said lupin again who seemed dazed by his own happiness. he strode around the table and hugged harry the scene in the basement of grimmauld place might never have happened. “you’ll be godfather?” he said as he released harry. “m-me?” stammered harry “you yes of course — dora quite agrees no one better — ” “i — yeah — blimey — ” harry felt overwhelmed astonished delighted now bill was hurrying to fetch wine and fleur was persuading lupin to join them for a drink. “i can’t stay long i must get back,” said lupin beaming around at them all he looked years younger than harry had ever seen him. “thank you thank you bill.” bill had soon filled all of their goblets they stood and raised them high in a toast. “to teddy remus lupin,” said lupin “a great wizard in the making!” “ ’oo does ’e look like?” fleur inquired. “i think he looks like dora but she thinks he is like me. not much hair. it looked black when he was born but i swear it’s turned ginger in the hour since. probably be blond by the time i get back. andromeda says tonks’s hair started changing color the day that she was born.” he drained his goblet. “oh go on then just one more,” he added beaming as bill made to fill it again. the wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled and bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. lupin’s news seemed to have taken them out of themselves removed them for a while from their state of siege tidings of new life were exhilarating. only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this until he saw bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs. “no ... no ... i really must get back,” said lupin at last declining yet another goblet of wine. he got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. “good-bye good-bye — i’ll try and bring some pictures in a few days’ time — they’ll all be so glad to know that i’ve seen you — ” he fastened his cloak and made his farewells hugging the women and grasping hands with the men then still beaming returned into the wild night. “godfather harry!” said bill as they walked into the kitchen together helping clear the table. “a real honor! congratulations!” as harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying bill pulled the door behind him closed shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others who were continuing to celebrate even in lupin’s absence. “i wanted a private word actually harry. it hasn’t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.” bill hesitated. “harry you’re planning something with griphook.” it was a statement not a question and harry did not bother to deny it. he merely looked at bill waiting. “i know goblins,” said bill. “i’ve worked for gringotts ever since i left hogwarts. as far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins i have goblin friends — or at least goblins i know well and like.” again bill hesitated. “harry what do you want from griphook and what have you promised him in return?” “i can’t tell you that,” said harry. “sorry bill.” the kitchen door opened behind them fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets. “wait,” bill told her. “just a moment.” she backed out and he closed the door again. “then i have to say this,” bill went on. “if you have struck any kind of bargain with griphook and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure you must be exceptionally careful. goblin notions of ownership payment and repayment are not the same as human ones.” harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort as though a small snake had stirred inside him. “what do you mean?” he asked. “we are talking about a different breed of being,” said bill. “dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries — but you’ll know all that from history of magic. there has been fault on both sides i would never claim that wizards have been innocent. however there is a belief among some goblins and those at gringotts are perhaps most prone to it that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure that they have no respect for goblin ownership.” “i respect — ” harry began but bill shook his head. “you don’t understand harry nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. to a goblin the rightful and true master of any object is the maker not the purchaser. all goblin-made objects are in goblin eyes rightfully theirs.” “but if it was bought — ” “ — then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. they have however great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. you saw griphook’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. he disapproves. i believe he thinks as do the fiercest of his kind that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. they consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment little more than theft.” harry had an ominous feeling now he wondered whether bill guessed more than he was letting on. “all i am saying,” said bill setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room “is to be very careful what you promise goblins harry. it would be less dangerous to break into gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.” “right,” said harry as bill opened the door “yeah. thanks. i’ll bear that in mind.” as he followed bill back to the others a wry thought came to him born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. he seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to teddy lupin as sirius black had been to him. gringotts their plans were made their preparations complete in the smallest bedroom a single long coarse black hair plucked from the sweater hermione had been wearing at malfoy manor lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece. “and you’ll be using her actual wand,” said harry nodding toward the walnut wand “so i reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.” hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite her as she picked it up. “i hate this thing,” she said in a low voice. “i really hate it. it feels all wrong it doesn’t work properly for me. ... it’s like a bit of her.” harry could not help but remember how hermione had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own telling him to simply practice. he chose not to repeat her own advice back to her however the eve of their attempted assault on gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her. “it’ll probably help you get in character though,” said ron. “think what that wand’s done!” “but that’s my point!” said hermione. “this is the wand that tortured neville’s mum and dad and who knows how many other people this is the wand that killed sirius!” harry had not thought of that he looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it to slice it in half with gryffindor’s sword which was propped against the wall beside him. “i miss my wand,” hermione said miserably. “i wish mr. ollivander could have made me another one too.” mr. ollivander had sent luna a new wand that morning. she was out on the back lawn at that moment testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. dean who had lost his wand to the snatchers was watching rather gloomily. harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to draco malfoy. he had been surprised but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as hermione ’s had done. remembering what ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands harry thought he knew what hermione ’s problem was she had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from bellatrix. the door of the bedroom opened and griphook entered. harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him but regretted his action at once he could tell that the goblin had noticed. seeking to gloss over the sticky moment he said “we’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff griphook. we’ve told bill and fleur we’re leaving tomorrow and we’ve told them not to get up to see us off.” they had been firm on this point because hermione would need to transform into bellatrix before they left and the less that bill and fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do the better. they had also explained that they would not be returning. as they had lost perkins’s old tent on the night that the snatchers caught them bill had lent them another one. it was now packed inside the beaded bag which harry was impressed to learn hermione had protected from the snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock. though he would miss bill fleur luna and dean not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of shell cottage. he was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard tired of being shut in the tiny dark bedroom. most of all he longed to be rid of griphook. however precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over gryffindor’s sword remained a question to which harry had no answer. it had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it because the goblin rarely left harry ron and hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time “he could give my mother lessons,” growled ron as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors. with bill’s warning in mind harry could not help suspecting that griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery. hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it ron on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few griphook-free moments had come up with nothing better than “well just have to wing it mate.” harry slept badly that night. lying awake in the early hours he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the ministry of magic and remembered a determination almost an excitement. now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety nagging doubts he could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. he kept telling himself that their plan was good that griphook knew what they were facing that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter yet still he felt uneasy. once or twice he heard ron stir and was sure that he too was awake but they were sharing the sitting room with dean so harry did not speak. it was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags dress in the semidarkness then creep out into the garden where they were to meet hermione and griphook. the dawn was chilly but there was little wind now that it was may. harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff he was going to miss the sound. small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of dobby’s grave now in a year’s time the mound would be covered in flowers. the white stone that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a weathered look. he realized now that they could hardly have laid dobby to rest in a more beautiful place but harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. looking down on the grave he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. his fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck through which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen dumbledore’s eye. then the sound of a door opening made him look around. bellatrix lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them accompanied by griphook. as she walked she was tucking the small beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from grimmauld place. though harry knew perfectly well that it was really hermione he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. she was taller than he was her long black hair rippling down her back her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him but then she spoke and he heard hermione through bellatrix’s low voice. “she tasted disgusting worse than gurdyroots! okay ron come here so i can do you. ...” “right but remember i don’t like the beard too long “oh for heaven’s sake this isn’t about looking handsome — ” “it’s not that it gets in the way! but i liked my nose a bit shorter try and do it the way you did last time.” hermione sighed and set to work muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of ron’s appearance. he was to be given a completely fake identity and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by bellatrix to protect him. meanwhile harry and griphook were to be concealed under the invisibility cloak. “there,” said hermione “how does he look harry?” it was just possible to discern ron under his disguise but only harry thought because he knew him so well. ron’s hair was now long and wavy he had a thick brown beard and mustache no freckles a short broad nose and heavy eyebrows. “well he’s not my type but he’ll do,” said harry. “shall we go then?” all three of them glanced back at shell cottage lying dark and silent under the fading stars then turned and began to walk toward the point just beyond the boundary wall where the fidelius charm stopped working and they would be able to disapparate. once past the gate griphook spoke. “i should climb up now harry potter i think?” harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back his hands linked in front of harry’s throat. he was not heavy but harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on. hermione pulled the invisibility cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both. “perfect,” she said bending down to check harry’s feet. “i can’t see a thing. let’s go.” harry turned on the spot with griphook on his shoulders concentrating with all his might on the leaky cauldron the inn that was the entrance to diagon alley. the goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness and seconds later harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on charing cross road. muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence. the bar of the leaky cauldron was nearly deserted. tom the stooped and toothless landlord was polishing glasses behind the bar counter a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at hermione and drew back into the shadows. “madam lestrange,” murmured tom and as hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently. “good morning,” said hermione and as harry crept past still carrying griphook piggyback under the cloak he saw tom look surprised. “too polite,” harry whispered in hermione’s ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard. “you need to treat people like they’re scum!” “okay okay!” hermione drew out bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. at once the bricks began to whirl and spin a hole appeared in the middle of them which grew wider and wider finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was diagon alley. it was quiet barely time for the shops to open and there were hardly any shoppers abroad. the crooked cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place harry had visited before his first term at hogwarts so many years before. more shops than ever were boarded up though several new establishments dedicated to the dark arts had been created since his last visit. harry’s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows always captioned with the words undesirable number one. a number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. he heard them moaning to the few passersby pleading for gold insisting that they were really wizards. one man had a bloody bandage over his eye. as they set off along the street the beggars glimpsed hermione. they seemed to melt away before her drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. hermione looked after them curiously until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path. “my children!” he bellowed pointing at her. his voice was cracked high-pitched he sounded distraught. “where are my children what has he done with them you know you know\” “i — i really — ” stammered hermione. the man lunged at her reaching for her throat then with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground unconscious. ron stood there his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots keen to vacate the scene. their entrance into diagon alley could hardly have been more conspicuous for a moment harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. before they could move or consult one another however they heard a cry from behind them. “why madam lestrange!” harry whirled around and griphook tightened his hold around harry’s neck a tall thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long sharp nose was striding toward them. “it’s travers,” hissed the goblin into harry’s ear but at that moment harry could not think who travers was. hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as she could muster “and what do you want?” travers stopped in his tracks clearly affronted. “ he’s another death eater\” breathed griphook and harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into hermione ’s ear. “i merely sought to greet you,” said travers coolly “but if my presence is not welcome ...” harry recognized his voice now travers was one of the death eaters who had been summoned to xenophilius’s house. “no no not at all travers,” said hermione quickly trying to cover up her mistake. “how are you?” “well i confess i am surprised to see you out and about bellatrix.” “really why?” asked hermione. “well,” travers coughed “i heard that the inhabitants of malfoy manor were confined to the house after the ... ah ... escape.” harry willed hermione to keep her head. if this was true and bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public — “the dark lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” said hermione in a magnificent imitation of bellatrix’s most contemptuous manner. “perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is travers.” though the death eater looked offended he also seemed less suspicious. he glanced down at the man ron had just stunned. “how did it offend you?” “it does not matter it will not do so again,” said hermione coolly. “some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said travers. “while they do nothing but beg i have no objection but one of them actually asked me to plead her case at the ministry last week. ‘i’m a witch sir i’m a witch let me prove it to youv ” he said in a squeaky impersonation. “as if i was going to give her my wand — but whose wand,” said travers curiously “are you using at the moment bellatrix i heard that your own was — ” “i have my wand here,” said hermione coldly holding up bellatrix’s wand. “i don’t know what rumors you have been listening to travers but you seem sadly misinformed.” travers seemed a little taken aback at that and he turned instead to ron. “who is your friend i do not recognize him.” “this is dragomir despard,” said hermione they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for ron to assume. “he speaks very little english but he is in sympathy with the dark lord’s aims. he has traveled here from transylvania to see our new regime.” “indeed how do you do dragomir?” “ ’ow you?” said ron holding out his hand. travers extended two fingers and shook ron’s hand as though frightened of dirtying himself. “so what brings you and your — ah — sympathetic friend to diagon alley this early?” asked travers. “i need to visit gringotts,” said hermione. “alas i also,” said travers. “gold filthy gold! we cannot live without it yet i confess i deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.” harry felt griphook’s clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. “shall we?” said travers gesturing hermione forward. hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. ron sloped along beside them and harry and griphook followed. a watchful death eater was the very last thing they needed and the worst of it was with travers marching at what he believed to be bellatrix’s side there was no means for harry to communicate with hermione or ron. all too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. as griphook had already warned them the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods. “ah probity probes,” sighed travers theatrically “so crude — but effective!” and he set off up the steps nodding left and right to the wizards who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. the probes harry knew detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. knowing that he had only seconds harry pointed draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured “confundo” twice. unnoticed by travers who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them. hermione ’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. “one moment madam,” said the guard raising his probe. “but you’ve just done that!” said hermione in bellatrix’s commanding arrogant voice. travers looked around eyebrows raised. the guard was confused. he stared down at the thin golden probe and then at his companion who said in a slightly dazed voice “yeah you’ve just checked them marius.” hermione swept forward ron by her side harry and griphook trotting invisibly behind them. harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold the wizards were both scratching their heads. two goblins stood before the inner doors which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. harry looked up at it and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven the most wonderful birthday of his life and hagrid standing beside him saying “ like i said yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal. ... but within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. the long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of the day. hermione ron and travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. hermione allowed travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to ron. the goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside said to nobody in particular “leprechaun,” and then greeted travers who passed over a tiny golden key which was examined and given back to him. hermione stepped forward. “madam lestrange!” said the goblin evidently startled. “dear me! how — how may i help you today?” “i wish to enter my vault,” said hermione. the old goblin seemed to recoil a little. harry glanced around. not only was travers hanging back watching but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at hermione. “you have ... identification?” asked the goblin. “identification i — i have never been asked for identification before!” said hermione. “ they know\” whispered griphook in harry’s ear. “they must have been warned there might be an impostor !” “your wand will do madam,” said the goblin. he held out a slightly trembling hand and in a dreadful blast of realization harry knew that the goblins of gringotts were aware that bellatrix’s wand had been stolen. “act now act now,” whispered griphook in harry’s ear “the imperius cursel” harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak pointed it at the old goblin and whispered for the first time in his life “imperiol” a curious sensation shot down harry’s arm a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. the goblin took bellatrix’s wand examined it closely and then said “ah you have had a new wand made madam lestrange!” “what?” said hermione. “no no that’s mine — ” “a new wand?” said travers approaching the counter again still the goblins all around were watching. “but how could you have done which wandmaker did you use?” harry acted without thinking pointing his wand at travers he muttered “imperiol” once more. “oh yes i see,” said travers looking down at bellatrix’s wand “yes very handsome. and is it working well i always think wands require a little breaking in don’t you?” hermione looked utterly bewildered but to harry’s enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment. the old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached. “i shall need the clankers,” he told the goblin who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal which he handed to his senior. “good good! so if you will follow me madam lestrange,” said the old goblin hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight “i shall take you to your vault.” he appeared around the end of the counter jogging happily toward them the contents of the leather bag still jingling. travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open. ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding travers with confusion. “wait — bogrod!” another goblin came scurrying around the counter. “we have instructions,” he said with a bow to hermione. “forgive me madam but there have been special orders regarding the vault of lestrange.” he whispered urgently in bogrod’s ear but the imperiused goblin shook him off. “i am aware of the instructions. madam lestrange wishes to visit her vault. ... very old family ... old clients ... this way please ...” and still clanking he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. harry looked back at travers who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant and made his decision with a flick of his wand he made travers come with them walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond which was lit with flaming torches. “we’re in trouble they suspect,” said harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the invisibility cloak. griphook jumped down from his shoulders neither travers nor bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of harry potter in their midst. “they’re imperiused,” he added in response to hermione and ron’s confused queries about travers and bogrod who were both now standing there looking blank. “i don’t think i did it strongly enough i don’t know. ...” and another memory darted through his mind of the real bellatrix lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an unforgivable curse “you need to mean them potter!” “what do we do?” asked ron. “shall we get out now while we can?” “if we can,” said hermione looking back toward the door into the main hall beyond which who knew what was happening. “we’ve got this far i say we go on,” said harry. “good!” said griphook. “so we need bogrod to control the cart i no longer have the authority. but there will not be room for the wizard.” harry pointed his wand at travers. “imperio\” the wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. “what are you making him do?” “hide,” said harry as he pointed his wand at bogrod who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it bogrod in front with griphook harry ron and hermione crammed together in the back. with a jerk the cart moved off gathering speed they hurtled past travers who was wriggling into a crack in the wall then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages sloping downward all the time. harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks his hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites flying ever deeper into the earth but he kept glancing back. they might as well have left enormous footprints behind them the more he thought about it the more foolish it seemed to have disguised hermione as bellatrix to have brought along bellatrix’s wand when the death eaters knew who had stolen it — they were deeper than harry had ever penetrated within gringotts they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them with seconds to spare a waterfall pounding over the track. harry heard griphook shout “no!” but there was no braking they zoomed through it. water filled harry’s eyes and mouth he could not see or breathe then with an awful lurch the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall heard hermione shriek something and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor. “c-cushioning charm,” hermione spluttered as ron pulled her to her feet but to harry’s horror he saw that she was no longer bellatrix instead she stood there in overlarge robes sopping wet and completely herself ron was red-haired and beardless again. they were realizing it as they looked at each other feeling their own faces. “the thief’s downfall!” said griphook clambering to his feet and looking back at the deluge onto the tracks which harry knew now had been more than water. “it washes away all enchantment all magical concealment! they know there are impostors in gringotts they have set off defenses against us!” harry saw hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the invisibility cloak. then he turned to see bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment the thief’s downfall seemed to have lifted the imperius curse. “we need him,” said griphook “we cannot enter the vault without a gringotts goblin. and we need the clankers!” “imperiol” harry said again his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. bogrod submitted once more to his will his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference as ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools. “harry i think i can hear people coming!” said hermione and she pointed bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried “protego\” they saw the shield charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway. “good thinking,” said harry. “lead the way griphook!” “how are we going to get out again?” ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. “let’s worry about that when we have to,” said harry. he was trying to listen he thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. “griphook how much farther?” “not far harry potter not far ...” and they turned a corner and saw the thing for which harry had been prepared but which still brought all of them to a halt. a gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. the beast’s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground its eyes were milkily pink both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. its great spiked wings folded close to its body would have filled the chamber if it spread them and when it turned its ugly head toward them it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble opened its mouth and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway. “it is partially blind,” panted griphook “but even more savage for that. however we have the means to control it. it has learned what to expect when the clankers come. give them to me.” ron passed the bag to griphook and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. griphook handed them out bogrod accepted his meekly. “you know what to do,” griphook told harry ron and hermione. “it will expect pain when it hears the noise it will retreat and bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.” they advanced around the corner again shaking the clankers and the noise echoed off the rocky walls grossly magnified so that the inside of harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. the dragon let out another hoarse roar then retreated. harry could see it trembling and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the clankers. “make him press his hand to the door!” griphook urged harry who turned his wand again upon bogrod. the old goblin obeyed pressing his palm to the wood and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets silver armor the skins of strange creatures — some with long spines others with drooping wings — potions in jeweled flasks and a skull still wearing a crown. “search fast!” said harry as they all hurried inside the vault. he had described hufflepuff’s cup to ron and hermione but if it was the other unknown horcrux that resided in this vault he did not know what it looked like. he barely had time to glance around however before there was a muffled clunk from behind them the door had reappeared sealing them inside the vault and they were plunged into total darkness. “no matter bogrod will be able to release us!” said griphook as ron gave a shout of surprise. “light your wands can’t you and hurry we have very little time!” “lumosl” harry shone his lit wand around the vault its beam fell upon glittering jewels he saw the fake sword of gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. ron and hermione had lit their wands too and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them. “harry could this be —  aargh!” hermione screamed in pain and harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. but as it fell it split became a shower of goblets so that a second later with a great clatter the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction the original impossible to discern amongst them. “it burned me!” moaned hermione sucking her blistered fingers. “they have added gemino and flagrante curses!” said griphook. “everything you touch will burn and multiply but the copies are worthless — and if you continue to handle the treasure you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!” “okay don’t touch anything!” said harry desperately but even as he said it ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot and twenty more exploded into being while ron hopped on the spot part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal. “stand still don’t move!” said hermione clutching at ron. “just look around!” said harry. “remember the cup’s small and gold it’s got a badger engraved on it two handles — otherwise see if you can spot ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere the eagle — ” they directed their wands into every nook and crevice turning cautiously on the spot. it was impossible not to brush up against anything harry sent a great cascade of fake galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets and now there was scarcely room to place their feet and the glowing gold blazed with heat so that the vault felt like a furnace. harry’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling higher and higher he raised the beam until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble. “it’s there it’s up there\” ron and hermione pointed their wands at it too so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight the cup that had belonged to helga hufflepuff which had passed into the possession of hepzibah smith from whom it had been stolen by tom riddle. “and how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?” asked ron. “accio cup\” cried hermione who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what griphook had told them during their planning sessions. “no use no use!” snarled the goblin. “then what do we do?” said harry glaring at the goblin. “if you want the sword griphook then you’ll have to help us more than — wait! can i touch stuff with the sword hermione give it here!” hermione fumbled inside her robes drew out the beaded bag rummaged for a few seconds then removed the shining sword. harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby which did not multiply. “if i can just poke the sword through a handle — but how am i going to get up there?” the shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them even ron who was tallest. the heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves and sweat ran down harry’s face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. they were truly trapped now there was no way out except through the door and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. harry looked at ron and hermione and saw terror in their faces. “hermione,” said harry as the clanking grew louder “i’ve got to get up there we’ve got to get rid of it — ” she raised her wand pointed it at harry and whispered “levicorpus.” hoisted into the air by his ankle harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies filling the cramped space. with screams of pain ron hermione and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects which also began to replicate. half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure they struggled and yelled as harry thrust the sword through the handle of hufflepuff’s cup hooking it onto the blade. “impervius\” screeched hermione in an attempt to protect herself ron and the goblins from the burning metal. then the worst scream yet made harry look down ron and hermione were waist-deep in treasure struggling to keep bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide but griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. harry seized griphook’s fingers and pulled. the blistered goblin emerged by degrees howling. “liberacorpus\” yelled harry and with a crash he and griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure and the sword flew out of harry’s hand. “get it!” harry yelled fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin as griphook clambered onto his shoulders again determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. “where’s the sword it had the cup on it!” the clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening — it was too late — “there!” it was griphook who had seen it and griphook who lunged and in that instant harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. one hand holding tightly to a fistful of harry’s hair to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of harry’s reach. the tiny golden cup skewered by the handle on the sword’s blade was flung into the air. the goblin still astride him harry dived and caught it and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it even while countless hufflepuff cups burst from his fist raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him ron and hermione into the outer chamber. hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword but griphook was gone. sliding from harry’s shoulders the moment he could he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins brandishing the sword and crying “thieves! thieves! help! thieves!” he vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question. slipping on the hot metal harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through. “stupefyl” he bellowed and ron and hermione joined in jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins and some toppled over but others advanced and harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner. the tethered dragon let out a roar and a gush of flame flew over the goblins the wizards fled doubled up back the way they had come and inspiration or madness came to harry. pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor he yelled “relashiol” the cuffs broke open with loud bangs. “this way!” harry yelled and still shooting stunning spells at the advancing goblins he sprinted toward the blind dragon. “harry — harry — what are you doing?” cried hermione. “get up climb up come on — ” the dragon had not realized that it was free harry’s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. the scales were hard as steel it did not even seem to feel him. he stretched out an arm hermione hoisted herself up ron climbed on behind them and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered. with a roar it reared harry dug in his knees clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles and it soared into the air. harry ron and hermione flat on its back scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks. “well never get out it’s too big!” hermione screamed but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again blasting the tunnel whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. by sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through. harry’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars he could only cling to its back expecting to be shaken off at any moment then he heard hermione yelling “defodiol” she was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air away from the shrieking and clanking goblins harry and ron copied her blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. they passed the underground lake and the great crawling snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it and behind them the passage was full of the dragon’s thrashing spiked tail of great lumps of rock gigantic fractured stalactites and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled while ahead the dragon’s fire kept their progress clear — and then at last by the combined force of their spells and the dragon’s brute strength they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance it took off and with harry ron and hermione still clinging to its back it forced its way through the metal doors leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges as it staggered into diagon alley and launched itself into the sky. the final hiding place there was no means of steering the dragon could not see where it was going and harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. nevertheless as they climbed higher and higher london unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. crouching low over the beast’s neck he clung tight to the metallic scales and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. behind him whether from delight or fear he could not tell ron kept swearing at the top of his voice and hermione seemed to be sobbing. after five minutes or so harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. he had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing nor how this particular dragon which could barely see would locate a good place to put down. he glanced around constantly imagining that he could feel his scar prickling. ... how long would it be before voldemort knew that they had broken into the lestranges’ vault how soon would the goblins of gringotts notify bellatrix how quickly would they realize what had been taken and then when they discovered that the golden cup was missing voldemort would know at last that they were hunting horcruxes. ... the dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air it climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud and harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. on and on they flew over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon. “what do you reckon it’s looking for?” ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north. “no idea,” harry bellowed back. his hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip. he had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them if the dragon headed for open sea he was cold and numb not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. when he wondered had the beast itself last eaten surely it would need sustenance before long and what if at that point it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back the sun slipped lower in the sky which was turning indigo and still the dragon flew cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. every part of harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s back. “is it my imagination,” shouted ron after a considerable stretch of silence “or are we losing height?” harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes coppery in the sunset. the landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. lower and lower the dragon flew in great spiraling circles honing in it seemed upon one of the smaller lakes. “i say we jump when it gets low enough!” harry called back to the others. “straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!” they agreed hermione a little faintly and now harry could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. “now!” he slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard plunging like a stone into a freezing green reed-filled world. he kicked toward the surface and emerged panting to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where ron and hermione had fallen. the dragon did not seem to have noticed anything it was already fifty feet away swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. as ron and hermione emerged spluttering and gasping from the depths of the lake the dragon flew on its wings beating hard and landed at last on a distant bank. harry ron and hermione struck out for the opposite shore. the lake did not seem to be deep soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming and at last they flopped sodden panting and exhausted onto slippery grass. hermione collapsed coughing and shuddering. though harry could have happily lain down and slept he staggered to his feet drew out his wand and started casting the usual protective spells around them. when he had finished he joined the others. it was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms and their clothing was singed away in places. they were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. hermione handed harry the bottle then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from shell cottage and clean dry robes for all of them. they changed and then gulped down the juice. “well on the upside,” said ron finally who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow “we got the horcrux. on the downside — ” “ — no sword,” said harry through gritted teeth as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath. “no sword,” repeated ron. “that double-crossing little scab ...” harry pulled the horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. glinting in the sun it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice. “at least we can’t wear it this time that’d look a bit weird hanging round our necks,” said ron wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking. “what’ll happen to it do you think?” she asked. “will it be all right?” “you sound like hagrid,” said ron. “it’s a dragon hermione it can look after itself. it’s us we need to worry about.” “what do you mean?” “well i don’t know how to break this to you,” said ron “but i think they might have noticed we broke into gringotts.” all three of them started to laugh and once started it was difficult to stop. harry’s ribs ached he felt lightheaded with hunger but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw. “what are we going to do though?” said hermione finally hiccuping herself back to seriousness. “he’ll know won’t he you know who will know we know about his horcruxes!” “maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” said ron hopefully. “maybe they’ll cover up — ” the sky the smell of lake water the sound of ron’s voice were extinguished pain cleaved harry’s head like a sword stroke. he was standing in a dimly lit room and a semicircle of wizards faced him and on the floor at his feet knelt a small quaking figure. “what did you say to me?” his voice was high and cold but fury and fear burned inside him. the one thing he had dreaded — but it could not be true he could not see how ... the goblin was trembling unable to meet the red eyes high above his. “say it again!” murmured voldemort. “ say it again).” “m-my lord,” stammered the goblin its black eyes wide with terror “m-my lord ... we t-tried t-to st-stop them. ... im-impostors my lord ... broke — broke into the — into the lestranges’ v-vault. ...” “impostors what impostors i thought gringotts had ways of revealing impostors who were they?” “it was ... it was . . . the p-potter b-boy and t-two accomplices. ...” “and they took?” he said his voice rising a terrible fear gripping him. “tell me! what did they take?” “a ... a s-small golden c-cup m-my lord ...” the scream of rage of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s he was crazed frenzied it could not be true it was impossible nobody had ever known how was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret the elder wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room the kneeling goblin rolled over dead the watching wizards scattered before him terrified bellatrix and lucius malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door and again and again his wand fell and those who were left were slain all of them for bringing him this news for hearing about the golden cup — alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down and they passed before him in vision his treasures his safeguards his anchors to immortality — the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen what if what if the boy knew about the others could he know had he already acted had he traced more of them was dumbledore at the root of this dumbledore who had always suspected him dumbledore dead on his orders dumbledore whose wand was his now yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy the boy — but surely if the boy had destroyed any of his horcruxes he lord voldemort would have known would have felt it he the greatest wizard of them all he the most powerful he the killer of dumbledore and of how many other worthless nameless men how could lord voldemort not have known if he himself most important and precious had been attacked mutilated true he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed but he had thought that was because he had no body to feel being less than ghost. ... no surely the rest were safe. ... the other horcruxes must be intact. ... but he must know he must be sure. ... he paced the room kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain the lake the shack and hogwarts — a modicum of calm cooled his rage now how could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the gaunt shack no one had ever known him to be related to the gaunts he had hidden the connection the killings had never been traced to him the ring surely was safe. and how could the boy or anybody else know about the cave or penetrate its protection the idea of the locket being stolen was absurd. ... as for the school he alone knew where in hogwarts he had stowed the horcrux because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place. ... and there was still nagini who must remain close now no longer sent to do his bidding under his protection. ... but to be sure to be utterly sure he must return to each of his hiding places he must redouble protection around each of his horcruxes. ... a job like the quest for the elder wand that he must undertake alone ... which should he visit first which was in most danger an old unease flickered inside him. dumbledore had known his middle name. ... dumbledore might have made the connection with the gaunts. ... their abandoned home was perhaps the least secure of his hiding places it was there that he would go first. ... the lake surely impossible ... though was there a slight possibility that dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds through the orphanage. and hogwarts . . . but he knew that his horcrux there was safe it would be impossible for potter to enter hogsmeade without detection let alone the school. nevertheless it would be prudent to alert snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. ... to tell snape why the boy might return would be foolish of course it had been a grave mistake to trust bellatrix and malfoy didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust he would visit the gaunt shack first then and take nagini with him he would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he strode from the room through the hall and out into the dark garden where the fountain played he called the snake in parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow. ... harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present he was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun and ron and hermione were looking down at him. judging by their worried looks and by the continued pounding of his scar his sudden excursion into voldemort’s mind had not passed unnoticed. he struggled up shivering vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him and the lake deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun. “he knows.” his own voice sounded strange and low after voldemort’s high screams. “he knows and he’s going to check where the others are and the last one,” he was already on his feet “is at hogwarts. i knew it. i knew it.” “what?” ron was gaping at him hermione sat up looking worried. “but what did you see how do you know?” “i saw him find out about the cup i — i was in his head he’s” — harry remembered the killings — “he’s seriously angry and scared too he can’t understand how we knew and now he’s going to check the others are safe the ring first. he thinks the hogwarts one is safest because snape’s there because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in i think he’ll check that one last but he could still be there within hours — ” “did you see where in hogwarts it is?” asked ron now scrambling to his feet too. “no he was concentrating on warning snape he didn’t think about exactly where it is — ” “wait wait\” cried hermione as ron caught up the horcrux and harry pulled out the invisibility cloak again. “we can’t just go we haven’t got a plan we need to — ” “we need to get going,” said harry firmly. he had been hoping to sleep looking forward to getting into the new tent but that was impossible now. “can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone what if he moves the hogwarts horcrux decides it isn’t safe enough?” “but how are we going to get in?” “well go to hogsmeade,” said harry “and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like. get under the cloak hermione i want to stick together this time.” “but we don’t really fit — ” “it’ll be dark no one’s going to notice our feet.” the flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water the dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. they paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher now black against the rapidly darkening sky until it vanished over a nearby mountain. then hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two. harry pulled the cloak down as far as it would go and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness. the missing mirror harry’s feet touched road. he saw the achingly familiar hogsmeade high street dark shop fronts and the outline of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward hogwarts and light spilling from the windows of the three broomsticks and with a lurch of the heart he remembered with piercing accuracy how he had landed here nearly a year before supporting a desperately weak dumbledore all this in a second upon landing — and then even as he relaxed his grip upon ron’s and hermione’s arms it happened. the air was rent by a scream that sounded like voldemort’s when he had realized the cup had been stolen it tore at every nerve in harry’s body and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. even as he looked at the other two beneath the cloak the door of the three broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded death eaters dashed into the street their wands aloft. harry seized ron’s wrist as he raised his wand there were too many of them to stun even attempting it would give away their position. one of the death eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped still echoing around the distant mountains. “accio cloak).” roared one of the death eaters. harry seized its folds but it made no attempt to escape the summoning charm had not worked on it. “not under your wrapper then potter?” yelled the death eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows “spread out. he’s here.” six of the death eaters ran toward them harry ron and hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street and the death eaters missed them by inches. they waited in the darkness listening to the footsteps running up and down beams of light flying along the street from the death eaters’ searching wands. “let’s just leave!” hermione whispered. “disapparate now!” “great idea,” said ron but before harry could reply a death eater shouted “we know you’re here potter and there’s no getting away! we’ll find you!” “they were ready for us,” whispered harry. “they set up that spell to tell them we’d come. i reckon they’ve done something to keep us here trap us — ” “what about dementors?” called another death eater. “let ’em have free rein they’d find him quick enough!” “the dark lord wants potter dead by no hand but his “ — an’ dementors won’t kill him! the dark lord wants potter’s life not his soul. he’ll be easier to kill if he’s been kissed first!” there were noises of agreement. dread filled harry to repel dementors they would have to produce patronuses which would give them away immediately. “we’re going to have to try to disapparate harry!” hermione whispered. even as she said it he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street. light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars which vanished. in the pitch-blackness he felt hermione take hold of his arm and together they turned on the spot. the air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid they could not disapparate the death eaters had cast their charms well. the cold was biting deeper and deeper into harry’s flesh. he ron and hermione retreated down the side street groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound. then around the corner gliding noiselessly came dementors ten or more of them visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. could they sense fear in the vicinity harry was sure of it they seemed to be coming more quickly now taking those dragging rattling breaths he detested tasting despair on the air closing in — he raised his wand he could not would not suffer the dementor’s kiss whatever happened afterward. it was of ron and hermione that he thought as he whispered “expecto patronum).” the silver stag burst from his wand and charged the dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight. “it’s him down there down there i saw his patronus it was a stag! the dementors had retreated the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the death eaters were becoming louder but before harry in his panic could decide what to do there was a grinding of bolts nearby a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street and a rough voice said “potter in here quick!” he obeyed without hesitation the three of them hurtled through the open doorway. “upstairs keep the cloak on keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure passing them on his way into the street and slamming the door behind him. harry had had no idea where they were but now he saw by the stuttering light of a single candle the grubby sawdust strewn bar of the hog’s head inn. they ran behind the counter and through a second doorway which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could. the stairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness. shouts reached them from the street below. still wearing the invisibility cloak they crept toward the grimy window and looked down. their savior whom harry now recognized as the hog’s head’s barman was the only person not wearing a hood. “so what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “so what you send dementors down my street i’ll send a patronus back at ’em! i’m not having ’em near me i’ve told you that i’m not having it!” “that wasn’t your patronus!” said a death eater. “that was a stag it was potter’s!” “stag!” roared the barman and he pulled out a wand. “stag! you idiot — expecto patronum .!” something huge and horned erupted from the wand head down it charged toward the high street and out of sight. “that’s not what i saw — ” said the death eater though with less certainty. “curfew’s been broken you heard the noise,” one of his companions told the barman. “someone was out in the street against regulations — ” “if i want to put my cat out i will and be damned to your curfew!” “ you set off the caterwauling charm?” “what if i did going to cart me off to azkaban kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door do it then if you want to! but i hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little dark marks and summoned him. he’s not going to like being called here for me and my old cat is he now?” “don’t you worry about us,” said one of the death eaters “worry about yourself breaking curfew!” “and where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub’s closed down what’ll happen to your little sidelines then?” “are you threatening — ” “i keep my mouth shut it’s why you come here isn’t it?” “i still say i saw a stag patronus!” shouted the first death eater. “stag?” roared the barman. “it’s a goat idiot!” “all right we made a mistake,” said the second death eater. “break curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!” the death eaters strode back toward the high street. hermione moaned with relief wove out from under the cloak and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. harry drew the curtains tight shut then pulled the cloak off himself and ron. they could hear the barman down below rebolting the door of the bar then climbing the stairs. harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece a small rectangular mirror propped on top of it right beneath the portrait of the girl. the barman entered the room. “you bloody fools,” he said gruffly looking from one to the other of them. “what were you thinking coming here?” “thank you,” said harry. “we can’t thank you enough. you saved our lives.” the barman grunted. harry approached him looking up into the face trying to see past the long stringy wire-gray hair and beard. he wore spectacles. behind the dirty lenses the eyes were a piercing brilliant blue. “it’s your eye i’ve been seeing in the mirror.” there was silence in the room. harry and the barman looked at each other. “you sent dobby.” the barman nodded and looked around for the elf. “thought he’d be with you. where ve you left him?” “he’s dead,” said harry. “bellatrix lestrange killed him.” the barman’s face was impassive. after a few moments he said “i’m sorry to hear it. i liked that elf.” he turned away lighting lamps with prods of his wand not looking at any of them. “you’re aberforth,” said harry to the man’s back. he neither confirmed nor denied it but bent to light the fire. “how did you get this?” harry asked walking across to sirius’s mirror the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before. “bought it from dung ’bout a year ago,” said aberforth. “albus told me what it was. been trying to keep an eye out for you.” ron gasped. “the silver doe!” he said excitedly. “was that you too?” “what are you talking about?” said aberforth. “someone sent a doe patronus to us!” “brains like that you could be a death eater son. haven’t i just proved my patronus is a goat?” “oh,” said ron. “yeah ... well i’m hungry!” he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble. “i got food,” said aberforth and he sloped out of the room reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread some cheese and a pewter jug of mead which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. ravenous they ate and drank and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire the clink of goblets and the sound of chewing. “right then,” said aberforth when they had eaten their fill and harry and ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “we need to think of the best way to get you out of here. can’t be done by night you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness caterwauling charm’s set off they’ll be onto you like bow-truckles on doxy eggs. i don’t reckon i’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time. wait for daybreak when curfew lifts then you can put your cloak back on and set out on foot. get right out of hogsmeade up into the mountains and you’ll be able to disapparate there. might see hagrid. he’s been hiding in a cave up there with grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.” “we’re not leaving,” said harry. “we need to get into hogwarts.” “don’t be stupid boy,” said aberforth. “we’ve got to,” said harry. “what you’ve got to do,” said aberforth leaning forward “is to get as far from here as you can.” “you don’t understand. there isn’t much time. we’ve got to get into the castle. dumbledore — i mean your brother — wanted us — ” the firelight made the grimy lenses of aberforth ’s glasses momentarily opaque a bright flat white and harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider aragog. “my brother albus wanted a lot of things,” said aberforth “and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. you get away from this school potter and out of the country if you can. forget my brother and his clever schemes. he’s gone where none of this can hurt him and you don’t owe him anything.” “you don’t understand,” said harry again. “oh don’t i?” said aberforth quietly. “you don’t think i understood my own brother think you knew albus better than i did?” “i didn’t mean that,” said harry whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “it’s ... he left me a job.” “did he now?” said aberforth. “nice job i hope pleasant easy sort of thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?” ron gave a rather grim laugh. hermione was looking strained. “i-it’s not easy no,” said harry. “but i’ve got to — ” “ ‘got to’ why ‘got to he’s dead isn’t he?” said aberforth roughly. “let it go boy before you follow him! save yourself!” “i can’t.” “why not?” “i — ” harry felt overwhelmed he could not explain so he took the offensive instead. “but you’re fighting too you’re in the order of the phoenix — ” “i was,” said aberforth. “the order of the phoenix is finished. you-know-who’s won it’s over and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves. it’ll never be safe for you here potter he wants you too badly. so go abroad go into hiding save yourself. best take these two with you.” he jerked a thumb at ron and hermione. “they’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.” “i can’t leave,” said harry. “i’ve got a job — ” “give it to someone else!” “i can’t. it’s got to be me dumbledore explained it all “oh did he now and did he tell you everything was he honest with you?” harry wanted with all his heart to say “yes,” but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips. aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. “i knew my brother potter. he learned secrecy at our mother’s knee. secrets and lies that’s how we grew up and albus ... he was a natural.” the old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. it was now harry looked around properly the only picture in the room. there was no photograph of albus dumbledore nor of anyone else. “mr. dumbledore?” said hermione rather timidly. “is that your sister ariana?” “yes,” said aberforth tersely. “been reading rita skeeter have you missy?” even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that hermione had turned red. “elphias doge mentioned her to us,” said harry trying to spare hermione. “that old berk,” muttered aberforth taking another swig of mead. “thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice he did. well so did plenty of people you three included by the looks of it.” harry kept quiet. he did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. he had made his choice while he dug dobby’s grave he had decided to continue along the winding dangerous path indicated for him by albus dumbledore to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know but simply to trust. he had no desire to doubt again he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. he met aberforth ’s gaze which was so strikingly like his brother’s the bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were x-raying the object of their scrutiny and harry thought that aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. “professor dumbledore cared about harry very much,” said hermione in a low voice. “did he now?” said aberforth. “funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d left ’em well alone.” “what do you mean?” asked hermione breathlessly. “never you mind,” said aberforth. “but that’s a really serious thing to say!” said hermione. “are you — are you talking about your sister?” aberforth glared at her his lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. then he burst into speech. “when my sister was six years old she was attacked set upon by three muggle boys. they’d seen her doing magic spying through the back garden hedge she was a kid she couldn’t control it no witch or wizard can at that age. what they saw scared them i expect. they forced their way through the hedge and when she couldn’t show them the trick they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.” hermione ’s eyes were huge in the firelight ron looked slightly sick. aberforth stood up tall as albus and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. “it destroyed her what they did she was never right again. she wouldn’t use magic but she couldn’t get rid of it it turned inward and drove her mad it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it and at times she was strange and dangerous. but mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. “and my father went after the bastards that did it,” said aberforth “and attacked them. and they locked him up in azkaban for it. he never said why he’d done it because if the ministry had known what ariana had become she’d have been locked up in st. mungo’s for good. they’d have seen her as a serious threat to the international statute of secrecy unbalanced like she was with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any longer. “we had to keep her safe and quiet. we moved house put it about she was ill and my mother looked after her and tried to keep her calm and happy. “i was her favorite,” he said and as he said it a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard. “not albus he was always up in his bedroom when he was home reading his books and counting his prizes keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day,’ ” aberforth sneered. “he didn’t want to be bothered with her. she liked me best. i could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my mother i could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages and when she was quiet she used to help me feed the goats. “then when she was fourteen ... see i wasn’t there,” said aberforth. “if i’d been there i could have calmed her down. she had one of her rages and my mother wasn’t as young as she was and ... it was an accident. ariana couldn’t control it. but my mother was killed.” harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion he did not want to hear any more but aberforth kept talking and harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this whether in fact he had ever spoken about it. “so that put paid to albus’s trip round the world with little doge. the pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then doge went off on his own and albus settled down as head of the family. ha!” aberforth spat into the fire. “i’d have looked after her i told him so i didn’t care about school i’d have stayed home and done it. he told me i had to finish my education and he’d take over from my mother. bit of a comedown for mr. brilliant there’s no prizes for looking after your half mad sister stopping her blowing up the house every other day. but he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.” and now a positively dangerous look crept over aberforth’s face. “grindelwald. and at last my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented as he was. and looking after ariana took a backseat then while they were hatching all their plans for a new wizarding order and looking for hallows and whatever else it was they were so interested in. grand plans for the benefit of all wizardkind and if one young girl got neglected what did that matter when albus was working for the greater good “but after a few weeks of it i’d had enough i had. it was nearly time for me to go back to hogwarts so i told ’em both of ’em face-to-face like i am to you now,” and aberforth looked down at harry and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager wiry and angry confronting his elder brother. “i told him you’d better give it up now. you can’t move her she’s in no fit state you can’t take her with you wherever it is you’re planning to go when you’re making your clever speeches trying to whip yourselves up a following. he didn’t like that,” said aberforth and his eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses they shone white and blind again. “grindelwald didn’t like that at all. he got angry. he told me what a stupid little boy i was trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother. ... didn’t i understand my poor sister wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the world and led the wizards out of hiding and taught the muggles their place “and there was an argument . . . and i pulled out my wand and he pulled out his and i had the cruciatus curse used on me by my brother’s best friend — and albus was trying to stop him and then all three of us were dueling and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off she couldn’t stand it — ” the color was draining from aberforth ’s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. “ — and i think she wanted to help but she didn’t really know what she was doing and i don’t know which of us did it it could have been any of us — and she was dead.” his voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. hermione’s face was wet with tears and ron was almost as pale as aberforth. harry felt nothing but revulsion he wished he had not heard it wished he could wash his mind clean of it. “i’m so ... i’m so sorry,” hermione whispered. “gone,” croaked aberforth. “gone forever.” he wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat. “ ’course grindelwald scarpered. he had a bit of a track record already back in his own country and he didn’t want ariana set to his account too. and albus was free wasn’t he free of the burden of his sister free to become the greatest wizard of the — ” “he was never free,” said harry. “i beg your pardon?” said aberforth. “never,” said harry. “the night that your brother died he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. he started screaming pleading with someone who wasn’t there. ‘don’t hurt them please ... hurt me instead.’ ” ron and hermione were staring at harry. he had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake the events that had taken place after he and dumbledore had returned to hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly. “he thought he was back there with you and grindelwald i know he did,” said harry remembering dumbledore whimpering pleading. “he thought he was watching grindelwald hurting you and ariana. . . . it was torture to him if you’d seen him then you wouldn’t say he was free.” aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. after a long pause he said “how can you be sure potter that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you how can you be sure you aren’t dispensable just like my little sister?” a shard of ice seemed to pierce harry’s heart. “i don’t believe it. dumbledore loved harry,” said hermione. “why didn’t he tell him to hide then?” shot back aberforth. “why didn’t he say to him take care of yourself here’s how to survive’?” “because,” said harry before hermione could answer “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety! sometimes you’ve got to think about the greater good! this is war!” “you’re seventeen boy!” “i’m of age and i’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up!” “who says i’ve given up?” “ the order of the phoenix is finished,’ ” harry repeated. “ tou know who’s won it’s over and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves.’ ” “i don’t say i like it but it’s the truth!” “no it isn’t,” said harry. “your brother knew how to finish you-know-who and he passed the knowledge on to me. i’m going to keep going until i succeed — or i die. don’t think i don’t know how this might end. i’ve known it for years.” he waited for aberforth to jeer or to argue but he did not. he merely scowled. “we need to get into hogwarts,” said harry again. “if you can’t help us we’ll wait till daybreak leave you in peace and try to find a way in ourselves. if you can help us — well now would be a great time to mention it.” aberforth remained fixed in his chair gazing at harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. at last he cleared his throat got to his feet walked around the little table and approached the portrait of ariana. “you know what to do,” he said. she smiled turned and walked away not as people in portraits usually did out of the sides of their frames but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. they watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. “er — what — ” began ron. “there’s only one way in now,” said aberforth. “you must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends dementors all around the boundary walls regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. the place has never been so heavily guarded. how you expect to do anything once you get inside it with snape in charge and the carrows as his deputies ... well that’s your lookout isn’t it you say you’re prepared to die.” “but what ... ” said hermione frowning at ariana’s picture. a tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel and now ariana was walking back toward them growing bigger and bigger as she came. but there was somebody else with her now someone taller than she was who was limping along looking excited. his hair was longer than harry had ever seen it he appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn. larger and larger the two figures grew until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. then the whole thing swung forward on the wall like a little door and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. and out of it his hair overgrown his face cut his robes ripped clambered the real neville longbottom who gave a roar of delight leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled “i knew you’d come! i knew it harryy’ the lost diadem “neville — what the — how — ” but neville had spotted ron and hermione and with yells of delight was hugging them too. the longer harry looked at neville the worse he appeared one of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple there were gouge marks on his face and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. nevertheless his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of hermione and said again “i knew you’d come! kept telling seamus it was a matter of time!” “neville what’s happened to you?” “what this?” neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. “this is nothing. seamus is worse. you’ll see. shall we get going then oh,” he turned to aberforth “ab there might be a couple more people on the way.” “couple more?” repeated aberforth ominously. “what d’you mean a couple more longbottom there’s a curfew and a caterwauling charm on the whole village!” “i know that’s why they’ll be apparating directly into the bar,” said neville. “just send them down the passage when they get here will you thanks a lot.” neville held out his hand to hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel ron followed then neville. harry addressed aberforth. “i don’t know how to thank you. you’ve saved our lives twice.” “look after ’em then,” said aberforth gruffly. “i might not be able to save ’em a third time.” harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind ariana’s portrait. there were smooth stone steps on the other side it looked as though the passageway had been there for years. brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth as they walked their shadows rippled fanlike across the wall. “how long’s this been here?” ron asked as they set off. “it isn’t on the marauder’s map is it harry i thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?” “they sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said neville. “there’s no chance of getting through any of them now not with curses over the entrances and death eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.” he started walking backward beaming drinking them in. “never mind that stuff. ... is it true did you break into gringotts did you escape on a dragon it’s everywhere everyone’s talking about it terry boot got beaten up by carrow for yelling about it in the great hall at dinner!” “yeah it’s true,” said harry. neville laughed gleefully. “what did you do with the dragon?” “released it into the wild,” said ron. “hermione was all for keeping it as a pet — ” “don’t exaggerate ron — ” “but what have you been doing people have been saying you’ve just been on the run harry but i don’t think so. i think you’ve been up to something.” “you’re right,” said harry “but tell us about hogwarts neville we haven’t heard anything.” “it’s been ... well it’s not really like hogwarts anymore,” said neville the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “do you know about the carrows?” “those two death eaters who teach here?” “they do more than teach,” said neville. “they’re in charge of all discipline. they like punishment the carrows.” “like umbridge?” “nah they make her look tame. the other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the carrows if we do anything wrong. they don’t though if they can avoid it. you can tell they all hate them as much as we do. “amycus the bloke he teaches what used to be defense against the dark arts except now it’s just the dark arts. we’re supposed to practice the cruciatus curse on people who’ve earned detentions “what?” harry ron and hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the passage. “yeah,” said neville. “that’s how i got this one,” he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek “i refused to do it. some people are into it though crabbe and goyle love it. first time they’ve ever been top in anything i expect. “alecto amycus’s sister teaches muggle studies which is compulsory for everyone. we’ve all got to listen to her explain how muggles are like animals stupid and dirty and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them and how the natural order is being reestablished. i got this one,” he indicated another slash to his face “for asking her how much muggle blood she and her brother have got.” “blimey neville,” said ron “there’s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.” “you didn’t hear her,” said neville. “you wouldn’t have stood it either. the thing is it helps when people stand up to them it gives everyone hope. i used to notice that when you did it harry.” “but they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said ron wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. neville shrugged. “doesn’t matter. they don’t want to spill too much pure blood so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.” harry did not know what was worse the things that neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them. “the only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. they get taken hostage. old xeno lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in the quihhler so they dragged luna off the train on the way back for christmas.” “neville she’s all right we’ve seen her — ” “yeah i know she managed to get a message to me.” from his pocket he pulled a golden coin and harry recognized it as one of the fake galleons that dumbledore’s army had used to send one another messages. “these have been great,” said neville beaming at hermione. “the carrows never rumbled how we were communicating it drove them mad. we used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls dumbledore’s army still recruiting stuff like that. snape hated it.” “you used to?” said harry who had noticed the past tense. “well it got more difficult as time went on,” said neville. “we lost luna at christmas and ginny never came back after easter and the three of us were sort of the leaders. the carrows seemed to know i was behind a lot of it so they started coming down on me hard and then michael corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up and they tortured him pretty badly. that scared people off.” “no kidding,” muttered ron as the passage began to slope upward. “yeah well i couldn’t ask people to go through what michael did so we dropped those kinds of stunts. but we were still fighting doing underground stuff right up until a couple of weeks ago. that’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me i suppose and they went for gran.” “they what?” said harry ron and hermione together. “yeah,” said neville panting a little now because the passage was climbing so steeply “well you can see their thinking. it had worked really well kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave i s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. thing was,” he faced them and harry was astonished to see that he was grinning “they bit off a bit more than they could chew with gran. little old witch living alone they probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. anyway,” neville laughed “dawlish is still in st. mungo’s and gran’s on the run. she sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes “telling me she was proud of me that i’m my parents’ son and to keep it up.” “cool,” said ron. “yeah,” said neville happily. “only thing was once they realized they had no hold over me they decided hogwarts could do without me after all. i don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to azkaban either way i knew it was time to disappear.” “but,” said ron looking thoroughly confused “aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into hogwarts?” “ ’course,” said neville. “you’ll see. we’re here.” they turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind ariana’s portrait. neville pushed it open and climbed through. as harry followed he heard neville call out to unseen people “look who it is! didn’t i tell you?” as harry emerged into the room beyond the passage there were several screams and yells “harry!” “it’s potter it’s potter!” “ron!” “hermionel” he had a confused impression of colored hangings of lamps and many faces. the next moment he ron and hermione were engulfed hugged pounded on the back their hair ruffled their hands shaken by what seemed to be more than twenty people they might just have won a quidditch final. “okay okay calm down!” neville called and as the crowd backed away harry was able to take in their surroundings. he did not recognize the room at all. it was enormous and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin. multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls which were covered in bright tapestry hangings harry saw the gold gryffindor lion emblazoned on scarlet the black badger of hufflepuff set against yellow and the bronze eagle of ravenclaw on blue. the silver and green of slytherin alone were absent. there were bulging bookcases a few broomsticks propped against the walls and in the corner a large wooden cased wireless. “where are we?” “room of requirement of course!” said neville. “surpassed itself hasn’t it the carrows were chasing me and i knew i had just one chance for a hideout i managed to get through the door and this is what i found! well it wasn’t exactly like this when i arrived it was a load smaller there was only one hammock and just gryffindor hangings. but it’s expanded as more and more of the d.a. have arrived.” “and the carrows can’t get in?” asked harry looking around for the door. “no,” said seamus finnigan whom harry had not recognized until he spoke seamus’s face was bruised and puffy. “it’s a proper hideout as long as one of us stays in here they can’t get at us the door won’t open. it’s all down to neville. he really gets this room. you’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need — like ‘i don’t want any carrow supporters to be able to get in’ — and it’ll do it for you! you’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! neville’s the man!” “it’s quite straightforward really,” said neville modestly. “i’d been in here about a day and a half and getting really hungry and wishing i could get something to eat and that’s when the passage to the hog’s head opened up. i went through it and met aberforth. he’s been providing us with food because for some reason that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.” “yeah well food’s one of the five exceptions to gamp’s law of elemental transfiguration,” said ron to general astonishment. “so we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said seamus “and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up — “ — and thought they’d quite like to wash yes,” supplied lavender brown whom harry had not noticed until that point. now that he looked around properly he recognized many familiar faces. both patil twins were there as were terry boot ernie macmillan anthony goldstein and michael corner. “tell us what you’ve been up to though,” said ernie. “there’ve been so many rumors we’ve been trying to keep up with you on potterwatch.” he pointed at the wireless. “you didn’t break into gringotts?” “they did!” said neville. “and the dragon’s true too!” there was a smattering of applause and a few whoops ron took a bow. “what were you after?” asked seamus eagerly. before any of them could parry the question with one of their own harry felt a terrible scorching pain in the lightning scar. as he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces the room of requirement vanished and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole and voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head. with an enormous effort he pulled out of voldemort’s mind again back to where he stood swaying in the room of requirement sweat pouring from his face and ron holding him up. “are you all right harry?” neville was saying. “want to sit down i expect you’re tired aren’t — ” “no,” said harry. he looked at ron and hermione trying to tell them without words that voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other horcruxes. time was running out fast if voldemort chose to visit hogwarts next they would miss their chance. “we need to get going,” he said and their expressions told him that they understood. “what are we going to do then harry?” asked seamus. “what’s the plan?” “plan?” repeated harry. he was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to voldemort’s rage his scar was still burning. “well there’s something we — ron hermione and i — need to do and then we’ll get out of here.” nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. neville looked confused. “what d’you mean ‘get out of here’?” “we haven’t come back to stay,” said harry rubbing his scar trying to soothe the pain. “there’s something important we need to do — ” “what is it?” “i — i can’t tell you.” there was a ripple of muttering at this neville’s brows contracted. “why can’t you tell us it’s something to do with fighting you-know-who right?” “well yeah — ” “then we’ll help you.” the other members of dumbledore’s army were nodding some enthusiastically others solemnly. a couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action. “you don’t understand.” harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. “we — we can’t tell you. we’ve got to do it — alone.” “why?” asked neville. “because ...” in his desperation to start looking for the missing horcrux or at least to have a private discussion with ron and hermione about where they might commence their search harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts. his scar was still searing. “dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said carefully “and we weren’t supposed to tell — i mean he wanted us to do it just the three of us.” “we’re his army,” said neville. “dumbledore’s army. we were all in it together we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own — ” “it hasn’t exactly been a picnic mate,” said ron. “i never said it had but i don’t see why you can’t trust us. everyone in this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here because the carrows were hunting them down. everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to dumbledore — loyal to you.” “look,” harry began without knowing what he was going to say but it did not matter the tunnel door had just opened behind him. “we got your message neville! hello you three i thought you must be here!” it was luna and dean. seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend. “hi everyone!” said luna happily. “oh it’s great to be back!” “luna,” said harry distractedly “what are you doing here how did you — ” “i sent for her,” said neville holding up the fake galleon. “i promised her and ginny that if you turned up i’d let them know. we all thought that if you came back it would mean revolution. that we were going to overthrow snape and the carrows.” “of course that’s what it means,” said luna brightly. “isn’t it harry we’re going to fight them out of hogwarts?” “listen,” said harry with a rising sense of panic “i’m sorry but that’s not what we came back for. there’s something we’ve got to do and then — ” “you’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded michael corner. “no!” said ron. “what we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end it’s all about trying to get rid of you-know-who — ” “then let us help!” said neville angrily. “we want to be a part of it!” there was another noise behind them and harry turned. his heart seemed to fail ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall closely followed by fred george and lee jordan. ginny gave harry a radiant smile he had forgotten or had never fully appreciated how beautiful she was but he had never been less pleased to see her. “aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said fred raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. “he wants a kip and his bar’s turned into a railway station.” harry’s mouth fell open. right behind lee jordan came harry’s old girlfriend cho chang. she smiled at him. “i got the message,” she said holding up her own fake galleon and she walked over to sit beside michael corner. “so what’s the plan harry?” said george. “there isn’t one,” said harry still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely. “just going to make it up as we go along are we my favorite kind,” said fred. “you’ve got to stop this!” harry told neville. “what did you call them all back for this is insane — ” “we’re fighting aren’t we?” said dean taking out his fake galleon. “the message said harry was back and we were going to fight! i’ll have to get a wand though “you haven’t got a wand — ” began seamus. ron turned suddenly to harry. “why can’t they help?” “what?” “they can help.” he dropped his voice and said so that none of them could hear but hermione who stood between them “we don’t know where it is. we’ve got to find it fast. we don’t have to tell them it’s a horcrux.” harry looked from ron to hermione who murmured “i think ron’s right. we don’t even know what we’re looking for we need them.” and when harry looked unconvinced “you don’t have to do everything alone harry.” harry thought fast his scar still prickling his head threatening to split again. dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but ron and hermione about the horcruxes. secrets and lies that’s how we grew up and albus ...he was a natural. ... was he turning into dumbledore keeping his secrets clutched to his chest afraid to trust but dumbledore had trusted snape and where had that led to murder at the top of the highest tower ... “all right,” he said quietly to the other two. “okay,” he called to the room at large and all noise ceased fred and george who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest fell silent and all of them looked alert excited. “there’s something we need to find,” harry said. “something — something that’ll help us overthrow you-know-who. it’s here at hogwarts but we don’t know where. it might have belonged to ravenclaw. has anyone heard of an object like that has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it for instance?” he looked hopefully toward the little group of ravenclaws to padma michael terry and cho but it was luna who answered perched on the arm of ginny’s chair. “well there’s her lost diadem. i told you about it remember harry the lost diadem of ravenclaw daddy’s trying to duplicate it.” “yeah but the lost diadem,” said michael corner rolling his eyes “is lost luna. that’s sort of the point.” “when was it lost?” asked harry. “centuries ago they say,” said cho and harry’s heart sank. “professor flitwick says the diadem vanished with ravenclaw herself. people have looked but,” she appealed to her fellow ravenclaws “nobody’s ever found a trace of it have they?” they all shook their heads. “sorry but what is a diadem?” asked ron. “it’s a kind of crown,” said terry boot. “ravenclaw’s was supposed to have magical properties enhance the wisdom of the wearer.” “yes daddy’s wrackspurt siphons — ” but harry cut across luna. “and none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?” they all shook their heads again. harry looked at ron and hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. an object that had been lost this long and apparently without trace did not seem like a good candidate for the horcrux hidden in the castle. ... before he could formulate a new question however cho spoke again. “if you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like i could take you up to our common room and show you harry ravenclaw’s wearing it in her statue.” harry’s scar scorched again for a moment the room of requirement swam before him and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. voldemort was flying again whether to the underground lake or here to the castle he did not know either way there was hardly any time left. “he’s on the move,” he said quietly to ron and hermione. he glanced at cho and then back at them. “listen i know it’s not much of a lead but i’m going to go and look at this statue at least find out what the diadem looks like. wait for me here and keep you know — the other one — safe.” cho had got to her feet but ginny said rather fiercely “no luna will take harry won’t you luna?” “oooh yes i’d like to,” said luna happily and cho sat down again looking disappointed. “how do we get out?” harry asked neville. “over here.” he led harry and luna to a corner where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. “it comes out somewhere different every day so they’ve never been able to find it,” he said. “only trouble is we never know exactly where we’re going to end up when we go out. be careful harry they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.” “no problem,” said harry. “see you in a bit.” he and luna hurried up the staircase which was long lit by torches and turned corners in unexpected places. at last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. “get under here,” harry told luna pulling out the invisibility cloak and throwing it over both of them. he gave the wall a little push. it melted away at his touch and they slipped outside harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. they were standing in a dark corridor harry pulled luna back into the shadows fumbled in the pouch around his neck and took out the marauder’s map. holding it close to his nose he searched and located his and luna’s dots at last. “we’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered watching filch moving away from them a corridor ahead. “come on this way.” they crept off. harry had prowled the castle at night many times before but never had his heart hammered this fast never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. through squares of moonlight upon the floor past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps around corners beyond which who knew what lurked harry and luna walked checking the marauder’s map whenever light permitted twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. he expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment his worst fear was peeves and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach. “this way harry,” breathed luna plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase. they climbed in tight dizzying circles harry had never been up here before. at last they reached a door. there was no handle and no keyhole nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. luna reached out a pale hand which looked eerie floating in midair unconnected to arm or body. she knocked once and in the silence it sounded to harry like a cannon blast. at once the beak of the eagle opened but instead of a bird’s call a soft musical voice said “which came first the phoenix or the flame?” “hmm . . . what do you think harry?” said luna looking thoughtful. “what isn’t there just a password?” “oh no you’ve got to answer a question,” said luna. “what if you get it wrong?” “well you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said luna. “that way you learn you see?” “yeah ... trouble is we can’t really afford to wait for anyone else luna.” “no i see what you mean,” said luna seriously. “well then i think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.” “well reasoned,” said the voice and the door swung open. the deserted ravenclaw common room was a wide circular room airier than any harry had ever seen at hogwarts. graceful arched windows punctuated the walls which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks by day the ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. the ceiling was domed and painted with stars which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. there were tables chairs and bookcases and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble. harry recognized rowena ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at luna’s house. the statue stood beside a door that led he guessed to dormitories above. he strode right up to the marble woman and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face beautiful yet slightly intimidating. a delicate looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. it was not unlike the tiara fleur had worn at her wedding. there were tiny words etched into it. harry stepped out from under the cloak and climbed up onto ravenclaw’s plinth to read them. “ ‘wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’ ” “which makes you pretty skint witless,” said a cackling voice. harry whirled around slipped off the plinth and landed on the floor. the sloping-shouldered figure of alecto carrow was standing before him and even as harry raised his wand she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm. the sacking of severus snape the moment her finger touched the mark harry’s scar burned savagely the starry room vanished from sight and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff and the sea was washing around him and there was triumph in his heart — they have the boy. a loud bang brought harry back to where he stood disoriented he raised his wand but the witch before him was already falling forward she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. “i’ve never stunned anyone except in our d.a. lessons,” said luna sounding mildly interested. “that was noisier than i thought it would be.” and sure enough the ceiling had begun to tremble. scurrying echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories luna’s spell had woken ravenclaws sleeping above. “luna where are you i need to get under the cloak!” luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere he hurried to her side and she let the cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of ravenclaws all in their nightclothes flooded into the common room. there were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw alecto lying there unconscious. slowly they shuffled in around her a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. then one brave little first year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe. “i think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight. “oh look,” whispered luna happily as the ravenclaws crowded in around alecto. “they’re pleased!” “yeah ... great ...” harry closed his eyes and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into voldemort’s mind. ... he was moving along the tunnel into the first cave. ... he had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming . . . but that would not take him long. . . . there was a rap on the common room door and every ravenclaw froze. from the other side harry heard the soft musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker “where do vanished objects go?” “i dunno do i shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice that harry knew was that of the carrow brother amycus. “alecto alecto are you there have you got him open the door!” the ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves terrified. then without warning there came a series of loud bangs as though somebody was firing a gun into the door. “alecto if he comes and we haven’t got potter — d’you want to go the same way as the malfoys answer me!” amyous bellowed shaking the door for all he was worth but still it did not open. the ravenclaws were all backing away and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds. then just as harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and stun amycus before the death eater could do anything else a second most familiar voice rang out beyond the door. “may i ask what you are doing professor carrow?” “trying — to get — through this damned — door!” shouted amycus. “go and get flitwick! get him to open it now!” “but isn’t your sister in there?” asked professor mcgonagall. “didn’t professor flitwick let her in earlier this evening at your urgent request perhaps she could open the door for you then you needn’t wake up half the castle.” “she ain’t answering you old besom! you open it! garn! do it now! “certainly if you wish it,” said professor mcgonagall with awful coldness. there was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again “where do vanished objects go?” “into nonbeing which is to say everything,” replied professor mcgonagall. “nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker and the door swung open. the few ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as amycus burst over the threshold brandishing his wand. hunched like his sister he had a pallid doughy face and tiny eyes which fell at once on alecto sprawled motionless on the floor. he let out a yell of fury and fear. “what’ve they done the little whelps?” he screamed. “i’ll cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it — and what’s the dark lord going to say?” he shrieked standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist. “we haven’t got him and they’ve gorn and killed her!” “she’s only stunned,” said professor mcgonagall impatiently who had stooped down to examine alecto. “she’ll be perfectly all right.” “no she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed amycus. “not after the dark lord gets hold of her! she’s gorn and sent for him i felt me mark burn and he thinks we’ve got potter!” “ ‘got potter’?” said professor mcgonagall sharply. “what do you mean ‘got potter’?” “he told us potter might try and get inside ravenclaw tower and to send for him if we caught him!” “why would harry potter try to get inside ravenclaw tower potter belongs in my house!” beneath the disbelief and anger harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice and affection for minerva mcgonagall gushed up inside him. “we was told he might come in here!” said carrow. “i dunno why do i?” professor mcgonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. twice they passed right over the place where harry and luna stood. “we can push it off on the kids,” said amycus his piglike face suddenly crafty. “yeah that’s what we’ll do. well say alecto was ambushed by the kids them kids up there” — he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories — “and we’ll say they forced her to press her mark and that’s why he got a false alarm. ... he can punish them. couple of kids more or less what’s the difference?” “only the difference between truth and lies courage and cowardice,” said professor mcgonagall who had turned pale “a difference in short which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. but let me make one thing very clear. you are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of hogwarts. i shall not permit it.” “excuse me?” amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to professor mcgonagall his face within inches of hers. she refused to back away but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat. “it’s not a case of what you’ll permit minerva mcgonagall. your time’s over. it’s us what’s in charge here now and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the price.” and he spat in her face. harry pulled the cloak off himself raised his wand and said “you shouldn’t have done that.” as amycus spun around harry shouted “crucio\” the death eater was lifted off his feet. he writhed through the air like a drowning man thrashing and howling in pain and then with a crunch and a shattering of glass he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled insensible to the floor. “i see what bellatrix meant,” said harry the blood thundering through his brain “you need to really mean it.” “potter!” whispered professor mcgonagall clutching her heart. “potter — you’re here! what —  how — ” she struggled to pull herself together. “potter that was foolish!” “he spat at you,” said harry. “potter i — that was very — very gallant of you — but don’t you realize — ” “yeah i do,” harry assured her. somehow her panic steadied him. “professor mcgonagall voldemort’s on the way.” “oh are we allowed to say the name now?” asked luna with an air of interest pulling off the invisibility cloak. this appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm professor mcgonagall who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown. “i don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” harry told luna. “he already knows where i am.” in a distant part of harry’s brain that part connected to the angry burning scar he could see voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. ... he had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood. ... “you must flee,” whispered professor mcgonagall. “now potter as quickly as you can!” “i can’t,” said harry. “there’s something i need to do. professor do you know where the diadem of ravenclaw is?” “the d-diadem of ravenclaw of course not — hasn’t it been lost for centuries?” she sat up a little straighter. “potter it was madness utter madness for you to enter this castle — ” “i had to,” said harry. “professor there’s something hidden here that i’m supposed to find and it could be the diadem — if i could just speak to professor flitwick — ” there was a sound of movement of clinking glass amycus was coming round. before harry or luna could act professor mcgonagall rose to her feet pointed her wand at the groggy death eater and said “imperio.” amycus got up walked over to his sister picked up her wand then shuffled obediently to professor mcgonagall and handed it over along with his own. then he lay down on the floor beside alecto. professor mcgonagall waved her wand again and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the carrows binding them tightly together. “potter,” said professor mcgonagall turning to face him again with superb indifference to the carrows’ predicament “if he-who-must-not-be-named does indeed know that you are here — ” as she said it a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through harry setting his scar on fire and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface — “potter are you all right?” said a voice and harry came back he was clutching luna’s shoulder to steady himself. “time’s running out voldemort’s getting nearer. professor i’m acting on dumbledore’s orders i must find what he wanted me to find! but we’ve got to get the students out while i’m searching the castle — it’s me voldemort wants but he won’t care about killing a few more or less not now — ” not now he knows i’m attacking horcruxes harry finished the sentence in his head. “you’re acting on dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. then she drew herself up to her fullest height. “we shall secure the school against he-who-must not-be-named while you search for this — this object.” “is that possible?” “i think so,” said professor mcgonagall dryly “we teachers are rather good at magic you know. i am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. of course something will have to be done about professor snape — ” “let me — ” “ — and if hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege with the dark lord at the gates it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. with the floo network under observation and apparition impossible within the grounds — ” “there’s a way,” said harry quickly and he explained about the passageway leading into the hog’s head. “potter we’re talking about hundreds of students — ” “i know professor but if voldemort and the death eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone who’s disapparating out of the hog’s head.” “there’s something in that,” she agreed. she pointed her wand at the carrows and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies tied itself around them and hoisted them into the air where they dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large ugly sea creatures. “come. we must alert the other heads of house. you’d better put that cloak back on.” she marched toward the door and as she did so she raised her wand. from the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. the patronuses ran sleekly ahead filling the spiral staircase with silvery light as professor mcgonagall harry and luna hurried back down. along the corridors they raced and one by one the patronuses left them professor mcgonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor and harry and luna jogged behind her under the cloak. they had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. harry whose scar was still prickling heard them first he felt in the pouch around his neck for the marauder’s map but before he could take it out mcgonagall too seemed to become aware of their company. she halted raised her wand ready to duel and said “who’s there?” “it is i,” said a low voice. from behind a suit of armor stepped severus snape. hatred boiled up in harry at the sight of him he had forgotten the details of snape ’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face how his black eyes had a dead cold look. he was not wearing nightclothes but was dressed in his usual black cloak and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight. “where are the carrows?” he asked quietly. “wherever you told them to be i expect severus,” said professor mcgonagall. snape stepped nearer and his eyes flitted over professor mcgonagall into the air around her as if he knew that harry was there. harry held his wand up too ready to attack. “i was under the impression,” said snape “that alecto had apprehended an intruder.” “really?” said professor mcgonagall. “and what gave you that impression?” snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm where the dark mark was branded into his skin. “oh but naturally,” said professor mcgonagall. “you death eaters have your own private means of communication i forgot.” snape pretended not to have heard her. his eyes were still probing the air all about her and he was moving gradually closer with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing. “i did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors minerva.” “you have some objection?” “i wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour?” “i thought i heard a disturbance,” said professor mcgonagall. “really but all seems calm.” snape looked into her eyes. “have you seen harry potter minerva because if you have i must insist — ” professor mcgonagall moved faster than harry could have believed her wand slashed through the air and for a split second harry thought that snape must crumple unconscious but the swiftness of his shield charm was such that mcgonagall was thrown off balance. she brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket harry about to curse snape was forced to pull luna out of the way of the descending flames which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at snape then it was no longer fire but a great black serpent that mcgonagall blasted to smoke which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him and with echoing clangs the daggers sank one after another into its breast — “minerva!” said a squeaky voice and looking behind him still shielding luna from flying spells harry saw professors flitwick and sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes with the enormous professor slughorn panting along at the rear. “no!” squealed flitwick raising his wand. “you’ll do no more murder at hogwarts!” flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which snape had taken shelter with a clatter it came to life. snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers harry and luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. when harry looked up again snape was in full flight mcgonagall flitwick and sprout all thundering after him he hurtled through a classroom door and moments later he heard mcgonagall cry “coward! coward !” “what’s happened what’s happened?” asked luna. harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor trailing the invisibility cloak behind them into the deserted classroom where professors mcgonagall flitwick and sprout were standing at a smashed window. “he jumped,” said professor mcgonagall as harry and luna ran into the room. “you mean he’s dead?” harry sprinted to the window ignoring flitwick’s and sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance. “no he’s not dead,” said mcgonagall bitterly. “unlike dumbledore he was still carrying a wand ... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.” with a tingle of horror harry saw in the distance a huge batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall. there were heavy footfalls behind them and a great deal of puffing slughorn had just caught up. “harry!” he panted massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. “my dear boy ... what a surprise ... minerva do please explain. ... severus ... what ... ” “our headmaster is taking a short break,” said professor mcgonagall pointing at the snape-shaped hole in the window. “professor!” harry shouted his hands at his forehead. he could see the inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore and voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart — “professor we’ve got to barricade the school he’s coming now!” “very well. he-who-must-not-be-named is coming,” she told the other teachers. sprout and flitwick gasped slughorn let out a low groan. “potter has work to do in the castle on dumbledore’s orders. we need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while potter does what he needs to do.” “you realize of course that nothing we do will be able to keep out you-know-who indefinitely?” squeaked flitwick. “but we can hold him up,” said professor sprout. “thank you pomona,” said professor mcgonagall and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. “i suggest we establish basic protection around the place then gather our students and meet in the great hall. most must be evacuated though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight i think they ought to be given the chance.” “agreed,” said professor sprout already hurrying toward the door. “i shall meet you in the great hall in twenty minutes with my house.” and as she jogged out of sight they could hear her muttering “tentacula. devil’s snare. and snargaluff pods ... yes i’d like to see the death eaters fighting those.” “i can act from here,” said flitwick and although he could barely see out of it he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. harry heard a weird rushing noise as though flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds. “professor,” harry said approaching the little charms master “professor i’m sorry to interrupt but this is important. have you got any idea where the diadem of ravenclaw is?” “ — protego horribilis — the diadem of ravenclaw?” squeaked flitwick. “a little extra wisdom never goes amiss potter but i hardly think it would be much use in this situation!” “i only meant — do you know where it is have you ever seen it?” “seen it nobody has seen it in living memory! long since lost boy!” harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. what then was the horcrux “we shall meet you and your ravenclaws in the great hall filius!” said professor mcgonagall beckoning to harry and luna to follow her. they had just reached the door when slughorn rumbled into speech. “my word,” he puffed pale and sweaty his walrus mustache aquiver. “what a to-do! i’m not at all sure whether this is wise minerva. he is bound to find a way in you know and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril — ” “i shall expect you and the slytherins in the great hall in twenty minutes also,” said professor mcgonagall. “if you wish to leave with your students we shall not stop you. but if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle then horace we duel to kill.” “minerva!” he said aghast. “the time has come for slytherin house to decide upon its loyalties,” interrupted professor mcgonagall. “go and wake your students horace.” harry did not stay to watch slughorn splutter he and luna ran after professor mcgonagall who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand. “piertotum — oh for heaven’s sake filch not now — ” the aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view shouting “students out of bed! students in the corridors!” “they’re supposed to be you blithering idiot!” shouted mcgonagall. “now go and do something constructive! find peeves!” “p-peeves?” stammered filch as though he had never heard the name before. “yes peeves you fool peevesl haven’t you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century go and fetch him at once!” filch evidently thought professor mcgonagall had taken leave of her senses but hobbled away hunch shouldered muttering under his breath. “and now — piertotum locomotori” cried professor mcgonagall. and all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same. “hogwarts is threatened!” shouted professor mcgonagall. “man the boundaries protect us do your duty to our school!” clattering and yelling the horde of moving statues stampeded past harry some of them smaller others larger than life. there were animals too and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains. “now potter,” said mcgonagall “you and miss lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the great hall — i shall rouse the other gryffindors.” they parted at the top of the next staircase harry and luna running back toward the concealed entrance to the room of requirement. as they ran they met crowds of students most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas being shepherded down to the great hall by teachers and prefects. “that was potter!” “ harry potted” “it was him i swear i just saw him!” but harry did not look back and at last they reached the entrance to the room of requirement. harry leaned against the enchanted wall which opened to admit them and he and luna sped back down the steep staircase. “wh — ” as the room came into view harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. it was packed far more crowded than when he had last been in there. kingsley and lupin were looking up at him as were oliver wood katie bell angelina johnson and alicia spinnet bill and fleur and mr. and mrs. weasley. “harry what’s happening?” said lupin meeting him at the foot of the stairs. “voldemort’s on his way they’re barricading the school — snape’s run for it — what are you doing here how did you know?” “we sent messages to the rest of dumbledore’s army,” fred explained. “you couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun harry and the d.a. let the order of the phoenix know and it all kind of snowballed.” “what first harry?” called george. “what’s going on?” “they’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the great hall to get organized,” harry said. “we’re fighting.” there was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him the mingled members of the order of the phoenix dumbledore’s army and harry’s old quidditch team all with their wands drawn heading up into the main castle. “come on luna,” dean called as he passed holding out his free hand she took it and followed him back up the stairs. the crowd was thinning only a little knot of people remained below in the room of requirement and harry joined them. mrs. weasley was struggling with ginny. around them stood lupin fred george bill and fleur. “you’re underage!” mrs. weasley shouted at her daughter as harry approached. “i won’t permit it! the boys yes but you you’ve got to go home!” “i won’t!” ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip. “i’m in dumbledore’s army — ” “a teenagers’ gang!” “a teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on which no one else has dared to do!” said fred. “she’s sixteen!” shouted mrs. weasley. “she’s not old enough! what you two were thinking bringing her with you — ” fred and george looked slightly ashamed of themselves. “mum’s right ginny,” said bill gently. “you can’t do this. everyone underage will have to leave it’s only right.” “i can’t go home!” ginny shouted angry tears sparkling in her eyes. “my whole family’s here i can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and — ” her eyes met harry’s for the first time. she looked at him beseechingly but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly. “fine,” she said staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the hog’s head. “i’ll say good-bye now then and—” there was a scuffling and a great thump someone else had clambered out of the tunnel overbalanced slightly and fallen. he pulled himself up on the nearest chair looked around through lopsided horn rimmed glasses and said “am i too late has it started i only just found out so i — i — ” percy spluttered into silence. evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. there was a long moment of astonishment broken by fleur turning to lupin and saying in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension “so — ’ow eez leetle teddy?” lupin blinked at her startled. the silence between the weasleys seemed to be solidifying like ice. “i — oh yes — he’s fine!” lupin said loudly. “yes tonks is with him — at her mother’s — ” percy and the other weasleys were still staring at one another frozen. “here i’ve got a picture!” lupin shouted pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to fleur and harry who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair waving fat fists at the camera. “i was a fool!” percy roared so loudly that lupin nearly dropped his photograph. “i was an idiot i was a pompous prat i was a — a — ” “ministry-loving family-disowning power-hungry moron,” said fred. percy swallowed. “yes i was!” “well you can’t say fairer than that,” said fred holding out his hand to percy. mrs. weasley burst into tears. she ran forward pushed fred aside and pulled percy into a strangling hug while he patted her on the back his eyes on his father. “i’m sorry dad,” percy said. mr. weasley blinked rather rapidly then he too hurried to hug his son. “what made you see sense perce?” inquired george. “it’s been coming on for a while,” said percy mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “but i had to find a way out and it’s not so easy at the ministry they’re imprisoning traitors all the time. i managed to make contact with aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that hogwarts was going to make a fight of it so here i am.” “well we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,” said george in a good imitation of percy’s most pompous manner. “now let’s get upstairs and fight or all the good death eaters’ll be taken.” “so you’re my sister-in-law now?” said percy shaking hands with fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with bill fred and george. “ginny!” barked mrs. weasley. ginny had been attempting under cover of the reconciliation to sneak upstairs too. “molly how about this,” said lupin. “why doesn’t ginny stay here then at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on but she won’t be in the middle of the fighting?” “that’s a good idea,” said mr. weasley firmly. “ginny you stay in this room you hear me?” ginny did not seem to like the idea much but under her father’s unusually stern gaze she nodded. mr. and mrs. weasley and lupin headed off for the stairs as well. “where’s ron?” asked harry. “where’s hermione?” “they must have gone up to the great hall already,” mr. weasley called over his shoulder. “i didn’t see them pass me,” said harry. “they said something about a bathroom,” said ginny “not long after you left.” “a bathroom?” harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the room of requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. it was empty. “you’re sure they said bath — ” but then his scar seared and the room of requirement vanished he was looking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged boars on pillars at either side looking through the dark grounds toward the castle which was ablaze with lights. nagini lay draped over his shoulders. he was possessed of that cold cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder. the battle of hogwarts the enchanted ceiling of the great hall was dark and scattered with stars and below it the four long house tables were lined with disheveled students some in traveling cloaks others in dressing gowns. here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. every eye living and dead was fixed upon professor mcgonagall who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the hall. behind her stood the remaining teachers including the palomino centaur firenze and the members of the order of the phoenix who had arrived to fight. ... evacuation will be overseen by mr. filch and madam pomfrey. prefects when i give the word you will organize your house and take your charges in an orderly fashion to the evacuation point.” many of the students looked petrified. however as harry skirted the walls scanning the gryffindor table for ron and hermione ernie macmillan stood up at the hufflepuff table and shouted “and what if we want to stay and fight?” there was a smattering of applause. “if you are of age you may stay,” said professor mcgonagall. “what about our things?” called a girl at the ravenclaw table. “our trunks our owls?” “we have no time to collect possessions,” said professor mcgonagall. “the important thing is to get you out of here safely.” “where’s professor snape?” shouted a girl from the slytherin table. “he has to use the common phrase done a bunk,” replied professor mcgonagall and a great cheer erupted from the gryffindors hufflepuffs and ravenclaws. harry moved up the hall alongside the gryffindor table still looking for ron and hermione. as he passed faces turned in his direction and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. “we have already placed protection around the castle,” professor mcgonagall was saying “but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. i must ask you therefore to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects — ” but her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the hall. it was high cold and clear there was no telling from where it came it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. like the monster it had once commanded it might have lain dormant there for centuries. “i know that you are preparing to fight.” there were screams amongst the students some of whom clutched each other looking around in terror for the source of the sound. “your efforts are futile. you cannot fight me. i do not want to kill you. i have great respect for the teachers of hogwarts. i do not want to spill magical blood.” there was silence in the hall now the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums that seems too huge to be contained by walls. “give me harry potter,” said voldemort’s voice “and none shall be harmed. give me harry potter and i shall leave the school untouched. give me harry potter and you will be rewarded. “you have until midnight.” the silence swallowed them all again. every head turned every eye in the place seemed to have found harry to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. then a figure rose from the slytherin table and he recognized pansy parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed “but he’s there! potter’s there someone grab him!” before harry could speak there was a massive movement. the gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing not harry but the slytherins. then the hufflepuffs stood and almost at the same moment the ravenclaws all of them with their backs to harry all of them looking toward pansy instead and harry awestruck and overwhelmed saw wands emerging everywhere pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves. “thank you miss parkinson,” said professor mcgonagall in a clipped voice. “you will leave the hall first with mr. filch. if the rest of your house could follow.” harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the slytherins trooping out on the other side of the hall. “ravenclaws follow on!” cried professor mcgonagall. slowly the four tables emptied. the slytherin table was completely deserted but a number of older ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out even more hufflepuffs stayed behind and half of gryffindor remained in their seats necessitating professor mcgonagall’s descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way. “absolutely not creevey go! and you peakes!” harry hurried over to the weasleys all sitting together at the gryffindor table. “where are ron and hermione?” “haven’t you found — ” began mr. weasley looking worried. but he broke off as kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind. “we’ve only got half an hour until midnight so we need to act fast! a battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of hogwarts and the order of the phoenix. professors flitwick sprout and mcgonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers — ravenclaw astronomy and gryffindor — where they’ll have a good overview excellent positions from which to work spells. meanwhile remus” — he indicated lupin — “arthur” — he pointed toward mr. weasley sitting at the gryffindor table — “and i will take groups into the grounds. we’ll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the passageways into the school — ” “sounds like a job for us,” called fred indicating himself and george and kingsley nodded his approval. “all right leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!” “potter,” said professor mcgonagall hurrying up to him as students flooded the platform jostling for position receiving instructions “ aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” “what oh,” said harry “oh yeah!” he had almost forgotten about the horcrux almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it the inexplicable absence of ron and hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind. “then go potter go!” “right — yeah — ” he sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the great hall again into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. he allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. he tried to calm himself to concentrate on finding the horcrux but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. without ron and hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. he slowed down coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the marauder’s map out of the pouch around his neck. he could not see ron’s or hermione’s names anywhere on it though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the room of requirement might he thought be concealing them. he put the map away pressed his hands over his face and closed his eyes trying to concentrate. ... voldemort thought i’d go to ravenclaw tower. there it was a solid fact the place to start. voldemort had stationed alecto carrow in the ravenclaw common room and there could only be one explanation voldemort feared that harry already knew his horcrux was connected to that house. but the only object anyone seemed to associate with ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the horcrux be the diadem how was it possible that voldemort the slytherin had found the diadem that had eluded generations of ravenclaws who could have told him where to look when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory in living memory ... beneath his fingers harry’s eyes flew open again. he leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come now in pursuit of his one last hope. the sound of hundreds of people marching toward the room of requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. prefects were shouting instructions trying to keep track of the students in their own houses there was much pushing and shoving harry saw zacharias smith bowling over first-years to get to the front of the queue here and there younger students were in tears while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings. ... harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor. “nick! nick! i need to talk to you!” he forced his way back through the tide of students finally reaching the bottom of the stairs where nearly headless nick ghost of gryffindor tower stood waiting for him. “harry! my dear boy!” nick made to grasp harry’s hands with both of his own harry’s felt as though they had been thrust into icy water. “nick you’ve got to help me. who’s the ghost of ravenclaw tower?” nearly headless nick looked surprised and a little offended. “the gray lady of course but if it is ghostly services you require — ” “it’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?” “let’s see. ...” nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither peering over the heads of the swarming students. “that’s her over there harry the young woman with the long hair.” harry looked in the direction of nick’s transparent pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of harry looking at her raised her eyebrows and drifted away through a solid wall. harry ran after her. once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared he saw her at the very end of the passage still gliding smoothly away from him. “hey — wait — come back!” she consented to pause floating a few inches from the ground. harry supposed that she was beautiful with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak but she also looked haughty and proud. close to he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor but to whom he had never spoken. “you’re the gray lady?” she nodded but did not speak. “the ghost of ravenclaw tower?” “that is correct.” her tone was not encouraging. “please i need some help. i need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.” a cold smile curved her lips. “i am afraid,” she said turning to leave “that i cannot help you.” “wait!” he had not meant to shout but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. he glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him it was a quarter to midnight. “this is urgent,” he said fiercely. “if that diadem’s at hogwarts i’ve got to find it fast.” “you are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said disdainfully. “generations of students have badgered me — ” “this isn’t about trying to get better marks!” harry shouted at her. “it’s about voldemort — defeating voldemort — or aren’t you interested in that?” she could not blush but her transparent cheeks became more opaque and her voice was heated as she replied “of course i — how dare you suggest — ” “well help me then!” her composure was slipping. “it — it is not a question of — ” she stammered. “my mother’s diadem — ” “your mother’s?” she looked angry with herself. “when i lived,” she said stiffly “i was helena ravenclaw.” “you’re her daughter but then you must know what happened to it!” “while the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together “i doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself lord — ” “haven’t i just told you i’m not interested in wearing it!” harry said fiercely. “there’s no time to explain — but if you care about hogwarts if you want to see voldemort finished you’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!” she remained quite still floating in midair staring down at him and a sense of hopelessness engulfed harry. of course if she had known anything she would have told flitwick or dumbledore who had surely asked her the same question. he had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice. “i stole the diadem from my mother.” “you — you did what?” “ i stole the diadem,” repeated helena ravenclaw in a whisper. “i sought to make myself cleverer more important than my mother. i ran away with it.” he did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask he simply listened hard as she went on “my mother they say never admitted that the diadem was gone but pretended that she had it still. she concealed her loss my dreadful betrayal even from the other founders of hogwarts. “then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. in spite of my perfidy she was desperate to see me one more time. she sent a man who had long loved me though i spurned his advances to find me. she knew that he would not rest until he had done so.” harry waited. she drew a deep breath and threw back her head. “he tracked me to the forest where i was hiding. when i refused to return with him he became violent. the baron was always a hot-tempered man. furious at my refusal jealous of my freedom he stabbed me.” “the baron you mean — ” “the bloody baron yes,” said the gray lady and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. “when he saw what he had done he was overcome with remorse. he took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself. all these centuries later he wears his chains as an act of penitence ... as he should,” she added bitterly. “and . . . and the diadem?” “it remained where i had hidden it when i heard the baron blundering through the forest toward me. concealed inside a hollow tree. “a hollow tree?” repeated harry. “what tree where was this?” “a forest in albania. a lonely place i thought was far beyond my mother’s reach.” “albania,” repeated harry. sense was emerging miraculously from confusion and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied dumbledore and flitwick. “you’ve already told someone this story haven’t you another student?” she closed her eyes and nodded. “i had ... no idea. . . . he was . . . flattering. he seemed to ... to understand ... to sympathize. ...” yes harry thought tom riddle would certainly have understood helena ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. “well you weren’t the first person riddle wormed things out of,” harry muttered. “he could be charming when he wanted. ...” so voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the gray lady. he had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place perhaps as soon as he left hogwarts before he even started work at borgin and burkes. and wouldn’t those secluded albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when so much later voldemort had needed a place to lie low undisturbed for ten long years but the diadem once it became his precious horcrux had not been left in that lowly tree. ... no the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home and voldemort must have put it there — “ — the night he asked for a job!” said harry finishing his thought. “i beg your pardon?” “he hid the diadem in the castle the night he asked dumbledore to let him teach!” said harry. saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. “he must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to or down from dumbledore ’s office! but it was still worth trying to get the job — then he might’ve got the chance to nick gryffindor’s sword as well — thank you thanks!” harry left her floating there looking utterly bewildered. as he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall he checked his watch. it was five minutes until midnight and though he now knew what the last horcrux was he was no closer to discovering where it was. ... generations of students had failed to find the diadem that suggested that it was not in ravenclaw tower — but if not there where what hiding place had tom riddle discovered inside hogwarts castle that he believed would remain secret forever lost in desperate speculation harry turned a corner but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening shattering crash. as he leapt aside a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. something large and furry detached itself whimpering from the new arrival and flung itself at harry. “hagrid!” harry bellowed fighting off fang the boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet. “what the — ” “harry yer here! yer here\” hagrid stooped down bestowed upon harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug then ran back to the shattered window. “good boy grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the window. “i’ll see yer in a moment there’s a good lad!” beyond hagrid out in the dark night harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird keening scream. he looked down at his watch it was midnight. the battle had begun. “blimey harry,” panted hagrid “this is it eh time ter fight?” “hagrid where have you come from?” “heard you-know-who from up in our cave,” said hagrid grimly. “voice carried didn’ it yeh got till midnight ter gimme potter.’ knew yeh mus’ be here knew what mus’ be happenin’. get down fang. so we come ter join in me an’ grawpy an’ fang. smashed our way through the boundary by the forest grawpy was carryin’ us fang an’ me. told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window bless him. not exac’ly what i meant bu’ — where’s ron an’ hermione?” “that,” said harry “is a really good question. come on.” they hurried together along the corridor fang lolloping beside them. harry could hear movement through the corridors all around running footsteps shouts through the windows he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. “where’re we goin’?” puffed hagrid pounding along at harry’s heels making the floorboards quake. “i dunno exactly,” said harry making another random turn “but ron and hermione must be around here somewhere. ...” the first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead the two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window. their remains stirred feebly on the floor and as harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads it moaned faintly “oh don’t mind me ... i’ll just lie here and crumble. ...” its ugly stone face made harry think suddenly of the marble bust of rowena ravenclaw at xenophilius’s house wearing that mad headdress — and then of the statue in ravenclaw tower with the stone diadem upon her white curls. ... and as he reached the end of the passage the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him that of an ugly old warlock onto whose head harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. the shock shot through harry with the heat of firewhisky and he nearly stumbled. he knew at last where the horcrux sat waiting for him. ... tom riddle who confided in no one and operated alone might have been arrogant enough to assume that he and only he had penetrated the deepest mysteries of hogwarts castle. of course dumbledore and flitwick those model pupils had never set foot in that particular place but he harry had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school — here at last was a secret he and voldemort knew that dumbledore had never discovered — he was roused by professor sprout who was thundering past followed by neville and half a dozen others all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants. “mandrakes!” neville bellowed at harry over his shoulder as he ran. “going to lob them over the walls — they won’t like this!” harry knew now where to go he sped off with hagrid and fang galloping behind him. they passed portrait after portrait and the painted figures raced alongside them wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches in armor and cloaks cramming themselves into each others’ canvases screaming news from other parts of the castle. as they reached the end of this corridor the whole castle shook and harry knew as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the order. “it’s all righ’ fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled hagrid but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air and hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog leaving harry alone. he forged on through the trembling passages his wand at the ready and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight sir cadogan rushed from painting to painting beside him clanking along in his armor screaming encouragement his fat little pony cantering behind him. “braggarts and rogues dogs and scoundrels drive them out harry potter see them off!” harry hurtled around a corner and found fred and a small knot of students including lee jordan and hannah abbott standing beside another empty plinth whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole. “nice night for it!” fred shouted as the castle quaked again and harry sprinted by elated and terrified in equal measure. along yet another corridor he dashed and then there were owls everywhere and mrs. norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws no doubt to return them to their proper place. ... “potter!” aberforth dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead his wand held ready. “i’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub potter!” “i know we’re evacuating,” harry said “voldemort’s “ — attacking because they haven’t handed you over yeah,” said aberforth “i’m not deaf the whole of hogsmeade heard him. and it never occurred to any of you to keep a few slytherins hostage there are kids of death eaters you’ve just sent to safety. wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?” “it wouldn’t stop voldemort,” said harry “and your brother would never have done it.” aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. your brother would never have done it. ... well it was the truth harry thought as he ran on again dumbledore who had defended snape for so long would never have held students ransom. ... and then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them ron and hermione both with their arms full of large curved dirty yellow objects ron with a broomstick under his arm. “where the hell have you been?” harry shouted. “chamber of secrets,” said ron. “chamber — what?” said harry coming to an unsteady halt before them. “it was ron all ron’s idea!” said hermione breathlessly. “wasn’t it absolutely brilliant there we were after you left and i said to ron even if we find the other one how are we going to get rid of it we still hadn’t got rid of the cup! and then he thought of it! the basilisk!” “what the — ” “something to get rid of horcruxes,” said ron simply. harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in ron and hermione’s arms great curved fangs torn he now realized from the skull of a dead basilisk. “but how did you get in there?” he asked staring from the fangs to ron. “you need to speak parseltongue!” “he did!” whispered hermione. “show him ron!” ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. “it’s what you did to open the locket,” he told harry apologetically. “i had to have a few goes to get it right but,” he shrugged modestly “we got there in the end.” “he was amazing.” said hermione. “amazing!” “so ...” harry was struggling to keep up. “so ...” “so we’re another horcrux down,” said ron and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of hufflepuff’s cup. “hermione stabbed it. thought she should. she hasn’t had the pleasure yet.” “genius!” yelled harry. “it was nothing,” said ron though he looked delighted with himself. “so what’s new with you?” as he said it there was an explosion from overhead all three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream. “i know what the diadem looks like and i know where it is,” said harry talking fast. “he hid it exactly where i hid my old potions book where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. he thought he was the only one to find it. come on.” as the walls trembled again he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the room of requirement. it was empty except for three women ginny tonks and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat whom harry recognized immediately as neville’s grandmother. “ah potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. “you can tell us what’s going on.” “is everyone okay?” said ginny and tonks together. “ ’s far as we know,” said harry. “are there still people in the passage to the hog’s head?” he knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it. “i was the last to come through,” said mrs. longbottom. “i sealed it i think it unwise to leave it open now aberforth has left his pub. have you seen my grandson?” “he’s fighting,” said harry. “naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “excuse me i must go and assist him.” with surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. harry looked at tonks. “i thought you were supposed to be with teddy at your mother’s?” “i couldn’t stand not knowing — ” tonks looked anguished. “she’ll look after him — have you seen remus?” “he was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds — ” without another word tonks sped off. “ginny,” said harry “i’m sorry but we need you to leave too. just for a bit. then you can come back in.” ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. “and then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after tonks. “ you’ve got to come back ini” “hang on a moment!” said ron sharply. “we’ve forgotten someone!” “who?” asked hermione. “the house-elves they’ll all be down in the kitchen won’t they?” “you mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked harry. “no,” said ron seriously “i mean we should tell them to get out. we don’t want any more dobbies do we we can’t order them to die for us — ” there was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of hermione ’s arms. running at ron she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted hermione off her feet. “is this the moment?” harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice. “01! there’s a war going on here!” ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other. “i know mate,” said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger “so it’s now or never isn’t it?” “never mind that what about the horcrux?” harry shouted. “d’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?” “yeah — right — sorry — ” said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face. it was clear as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs that in the minutes that they had spent in the room of requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely the walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever dust filled the air and through the nearest window harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the death eaters must be very near to entering the place. looking down harry saw grawp the giant meandering past swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure. “let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said ron as more screams echoed from close by. “as long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice harry turned and saw ginny and tonks both with their wands drawn at the next window which was missing several panes. even as he watched ginny sent a well aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. “good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them and harry saw aberforth again his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. “they look like they might be breaching the north battlements they’ve brought giants of their own!” “have you seen remus?” tonks called after him. “he was dueling dolohov,” shouted aberforth “haven’t seen him since! “tonks,” said ginny “tonks i’m sure he’s okay — ” but tonks had run off into the dust after aberforth. ginny turned helpless to harry ron and hermione. “they’ll be all right,” said harry though he knew they were empty words. “ginny we’ll be back in a moment just keep out of the way keep safe — come on!” he said to ron and hermione and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the room of requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant. i need the place where everything is hidden harry begged of it inside his head and the door materialized on their third run past. the furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them all was silent. they were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students. “and he never realized anyone could get in?” said ron his voice echoing in the silence. “he thought he was the only one,” said harry. “too bad for him i’ve had to hide stuff in my time ... this way,” he added “i think it’s down here. ...” he passed the stuffed troll and the vanishing cabinet draco malfoy had mended last year with such disastrous consequences then hesitated looking up and down aisles of junk he could not remember where to go next. ... “ accio diadem).” cried hermione in desperation but nothing flew through the air toward them. it seemed that like the vault at gringotts the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily. “let’s split up,” harry told the other two. “look for a stone bust of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara! it’s standing on a cupboard and it’s definitely somewhere near here. ...” they sped off up adjacent aisles harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk of bottles hats crates chairs books weapons broomsticks bats. ... “somewhere near here,” harry muttered to himself. “somewhere ... somewhere ...” deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room. his breath was loud in his ears and then his very soul seemed to shiver there it was right ahead the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old potions book and on top of it the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara. he had already stretched out his hand though he remained ten feet away when a voice behind him said “hold it potter.” he skidded to a halt and turned around. crabbe and goyle were standing behind him shoulder to shoulder wands pointing right at harry. through the small space between their leering faces he saw draco malfoy. “that’s my wand you’re holding potter,” said malfoy pointing his own through the gap between crabbe and goyle. “not anymore,” panted harry tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. “winners keepers malfoy. who’s lent you theirs?” “my mother,” said draco. harry laughed though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. he could not hear ron or hermione anymore. they seemed to have run out of earshot searching for the diadem. “so how come you three aren’t with voldemort?” asked harry. “we’re gonna be rewarded,” said crabbe his voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. “we ’ung back potter. we decided not to go. decided to bring you to ’im.” “good plan,” said harry in mock admiration. he could not believe that he was this close and was going to be thwarted by malfoy crabbe and goyle. he began edging slowly backward toward the place where the horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. if he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . . “so how did you get in here?” he asked trying to distract them. “i virtually lived in the room of hidden things all last year,” said malfoy his voice brittle. “i know how to get in.” “we was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted goyle. “we can do diss-lusion charms now! and then,” his face split into a gormless grin “you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! what’s a die-dum?” “harry?” ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to harry’s right. “are you talking to someone?” with a whiplike movement crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture of broken trunks of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk and shouted “descendov’ the wall began to totter then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where ron stood. “ron!” harry bellowed as somewhere out of sight hermione screamed and harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall he pointed his wand at the rampart cried “finite!” and it steadied. “no!” shouted malfoy staying crabbe’s arm as the latter made to repeat his spell. “if you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!” “what’s that matter?” said crabbe tugging himself free. “it’s potter the dark lord wants who cares about a die-dum?” “potter came in here to get it,” said malfoy with ill disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues “so that must mean — ” “ ‘must mean?” crabbe turned on malfoy with undisguised ferocity. “who cares what you think i don’t take your orders no more draco. you an’ your dad are finished.” “harry?” shouted ron again from the other side of the junk wall. “what’s going on?” “harry?” mimicked crabbe. “what’s going — no potter! cruciol” harry had lunged for the tiara crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the stone bust which flew into the air the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested. “stop!” malfoy shouted at crabbe his voice echoing through the enormous room. “the dark lord wants him alive — ” “so i’m not killing him am i?” yelled crabbe throwing off malfoy’s restraining arm. “but if i can i will the dark lord wants him dead anyway what’s thediff— ” a jet of scarlet light shot past harry by inches hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a stunning spell straight at crabbe ’s head. it only missed because malfoy pulled him out of the way. “it’s that mudblood! avada kedavral” harry saw hermione dive aside and his fury that crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. he shot a stunning spell at crabbe who lurched out of the way knocking malfoy’s wand out of his hand it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes. “don’t kill him! dont kill him!” malfoy yelled at crabbe and goyle who were both aiming at harry their split second’s hesitation was all harry needed. “ expelliarmusl” goyle ’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him goyle leapt foolishly on the spot trying to retrieve it malfoy jumped out of range of hermione ’s second stunning spell and ron appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle shot a full body-bind curse at crabbe which narrowly missed. crabbe wheeled around and screamed “avada kedavray’ again. ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. the wandless malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as hermione charged toward them hitting goyle with a stunning spell as she came. “it’s somewhere here!” harry yelled at her pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. “look for it while i go and help r — ” “harry!” she screamed. a roaring billowing noise behind him gave him a moment’s warning. he turned and saw both ron and crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. “like it hot scum?” roared crabbe as he ran. but he seemed to have no control over what he had done. flames of abnormal size were pursuing them licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks which were crumbling to soot at their touch. “aguamenti\” harry bawled but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air. “run!” malfoy grabbed the stunned goyle and dragged him along crabbe outstripped all of them now looking terrified harry ron and hermione pelted along in his wake and the fire pursued them. it was not normal fire crabbe had used a curse of which harry had no knowledge as they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive sentient intent upon killing them. now the fire was mutating forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts flaming serpents chimaeras and dragons rose and fell and rose again and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths tossed high on clawed feet before being consumed by the inferno. malfoy crabbe and goyle had vanished from view harry ron and hermione stopped dead the fiery monsters were circling them drawing closer and closer claws and horns and tails lashed and the heat was solid as a wall around them. “what can we do?” hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. “what can we do?” “here!” harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to ron who pulled hermione onto it behind him. harry swung his leg over the second broom and with hard kicks to the ground they soared up into the air missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. the smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. harry could not see a trace of malfoy crabbe or goyle anywhere he swooped as low as he dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them but there was nothing but fire what a terrible way to die. ... he had never wanted this. ... “harry let’s get out let’s get out!” bellowed ron though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke. and then harry heard a thin piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion the thunder of devouring flame. “it’s — too — dangerous — !” ron yelled but harry wheeled in the air. his glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke he raked the firestorm below seeking a sign of life a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. ... and he saw them malfoy with his arms around the unconscious goyle the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks and harry dived. malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm but even as harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good goyle was too heavy and malfoy ’s hand covered in sweat slid instantly out of harry’s — “if we die for them i’ll kill you harry!” roared ron’s voice and as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them he and hermione dragged goyle onto their broom and rose rolling and pitching into the air once more as malfoy clambered up behind harry. “the door get to the door the door!” screamed malfoy in harry’s ear and harry sped up following ron hermione and goyle through the billowing black smoke hardly able to breathe and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration cups and shields a sparkling necklace and an old discolored tiara — “ what are you doing what are you doing the door’s that way\” screamed malfoy but harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. the diadem seemed to fall in slow motion turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent and then he had it caught it around his wrist — harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him he soared upward and straight toward the place where he prayed the door stood open ron hermione and goyle had vanished malfoy was screaming and holding harry so tightly it hurt. then through the smoke harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond. malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown gasping coughing and retching. harry rolled over and sat up the door to the room of requirement had vanished and ron and hermione sat panting on the floor beside goyle who was still unconscious. “c-crabbe,” choked malfoy as soon as he could speak. “c-crabbe ...” “he’s dead,” said ron harshly. there was silence apart from panting and coughing. then a number of huge bangs shook the castle and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. harry staggered to his feet when the headless hunt had passed and looked around the battle was still going on all around him. he could hear more screams than those of the retreating ghosts. panic flared within him. “where’s ginny?” he said sharply. “she was here. she was supposed to be going back into the room of requirement.” “blimey d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked ron but he too got to his feet rubbing his chest and looking left and right. “shall we split up and look — ” “no,” said hermione getting to her feet too. malfoy and goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor neither of them had wands. “let’s stick together. i say we go — harry what’s that on your arm?” “what oh yeah — ” he pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. it was still hot blackened with soot but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure. a bloodlike substance dark and tarry seemed to be leaking from the diadem. suddenly harry felt the thing vibrate violently then break apart in his hands and as it did so he thought he heard the faintest most distant scream of pain echoing not from the grounds or the castle but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers. “it must have been fiendfyre!” whimpered hermione her eyes on the broken pieces. “sorry?” “fiendfyre — cursed fire — it’s one of the substances that destroy horcruxes but i would never ever have dared use it it’s so dangerous — how did crabbe know how to — ” “must’ve learned from the carrows,” said harry grimly. “shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it really,” said ron whose hair like hermione’s was singed and whose face was blackened. “if he hadn’t tried to kill us all i’d be quite sorry he was dead.” “but don’t you realize?” whispered hermione. “this means if we can just get the snake — ” but she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail death eaters had penetrated hogwarts. fred and percy had just backed into view both of them dueling masked and hooded men. harry ron and hermione ran forward to help jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling percy backed off fast then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair — “hello minister!” bellowed percy sending a neat jinx straight at thicknesse who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes apparently in awful discomfort. “did i mention i’m resigning?” “you’re joking perce!” shouted fred as the death eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate stunning spells. thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. fred looked at percy with glee. “you actually are joking perce. ... i don’t think i’ve heard you joke since you were — ” the air exploded. they had been grouped together harry ron hermione fred and percy the two death eaters at their feet one stunned the other transfigured and in that fragment of a moment when danger seemed temporarily at bay the world was rent apart. harry felt himself flying through the air and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon and shield his head in his arms he heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them — and then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness he was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause and he stood up swaying more frightened than he had been that day more frightened perhaps than he had been in his life. ... and hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. harry grabbed hermione ’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. “no — no — no!” someone was shouting. “no! fred! no!” and percy was shaking his brother and ron was kneeling beside them and fred’s eyes stared without seeing the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face. the elder wand the world had ended so why had the battle not ceased the castle fallen silent in horror and every combatant laid down their arms harry’s mind was in free fall spinning out of control unable to grasp the impossibility because fred weasley could not be dead the evidence of all his senses must be lying — and then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness hitting the wall behind their heads. “get down!” harry shouted as more curses flew through the night he and ron had both grabbed hermione and pulled her to the floor but percy lay across fred’s body shielding it from further harm and when harry shouted “percy come on we’ve got to move!” he shook his head. “percy!” harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating ron’s face as he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled but percy would not budge. “percy you can’t do anything for him! we’re going to hermione screamed and harry turning did not need to ask why. a monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall one of aragog’s descendants had joined the fight. ron and harry shouted together their spells collided and the monster was blown backward its legs jerking horribly and vanished into the darkness. “it brought friends!” harry called to the others glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted more giant spiders were climbing the side of the building liberated from the forbidden forest into which the death eaters must have penetrated. harry fired stunning spells down upon them knocking the lead monster into its fellows so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. then more curses came soaring over harry’s head so close he felt the force of them blow his hair. “let’s move now!” pushing hermione ahead of him with ron harry stooped to seize fred’s body under the armpits. percy realizing what harry was trying to do stopped clinging to the body and helped together crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds they hauled fred out of the way. “here,” said harry and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. he could not bear to look at fred a second longer than he had to and after making sure that the body was well hidden he took off after ron and hermione. malfoy and goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor which was now full of dust and falling masonry glass long gone from the windows he saw many people running backward and forward whether friends or foes he could not tell. rounding the corner percy let out a bull-like roar “rookwood!” and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man who was pursuing a couple of students. “harry in here!” hermione screamed. she had pulled ron behind a tapestry they seemed to be wrestling together and for one mad second harry thought that they were embracing again then he saw that hermione was trying to restrain ron to stop him running after percy. “listen to me — listen rom” “i wanna help — i wanna kill death eaters — ” his face was contorted smeared with dust and smoke and he was shaking with rage and grief. “ron we’re the only ones who can end it! please — ron — we need the snake we’ve got to kill the snake!” said hermione. but harry knew how ron felt pursuing another horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge he too wanted to fight to punish them the people who had killed fred and he wanted to find the other weasleys and above all make sure make quite sure that ginny was not — but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind — “we will fight!” hermione said. “we’ll have to to reach the snake! but let’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be d-doing! we’re the only ones who can end it!” she was crying too and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as still keeping a tight hold on ron she turned to harry. “you need to find out where voldemort is because hell have the snake with him won’t he do it harry — look inside him!” why was it so easy because his scar had been burning for hours yearning to show him voldemort’s thoughts he closed his eyes on her command and at once the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant as though he stood far far away from them. ... he was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one. the sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. the single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood but inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. he was rolling his wand between his fingers watching it his thoughts on the room in the castle the secret room only he had ever found the room like the chamber that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discover. . . . he was confident that the boy would not find the diadem . . . although dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he had ever expected . . . too far. . . . “my lord,” said a voice desperate and cracked. he turned there was lucius malfoy sitting in the darkest corner ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy’s last escape. one of his eyes remained closed and puffy. “my lord ... please ... my son ...” “if your son is dead lucius it is not my fault. he did not come and join me like the rest of the slytherins. perhaps he has decided to befriend harry potter?” “no — never,” whispered malfoy. “you must hope not.” “aren’t — aren’t you afraid my lord that potter might die at another hand but yours?” asked malfoy his voice shaking. “wouldn’t it be ... forgive me ... more prudent to call off this battle enter the castle and seek him y-yourself?” “do not pretend lucius. you wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. and i do not need to seek potter. before the night is out potter will have come to find me.” voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. it troubled him ... and those things that troubled lord voldemort needed to be rearranged. ... “go and fetch snape.” “snape m-my lord?” “snape. now. i need him. there is a — service — i require from him. go.” frightened stumbling a little through the gloom lucius left the room. voldemort continued to stand there twirling the wand between his fingers staring at it. “it is the only way nagini,” he whispered and he looked around and there was the great thick snake now suspended in midair twisting gracefully within the enchanted protected space he had made for her a starry transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank. with a gasp harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries the smashes and bangs of battle. “he’s in the shrieking shack. the snake’s with him it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. he’s just sent lucius malfoy to find snape.” “voldemort’s sitting in the shrieking shack?” said hermione outraged. “he’s not — he’s not even fighting?” “he doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said harry. “he thinks i’m going to go to him.” “but why?” “he knows i’m after horcruxes — he’s keeping nagini close beside him — obviously i’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing — ” “right,” said ron squaring his shoulders. “so you can’t go that’s what he wants what he’s expecting. you stay here and look after hermione and i’ll go and get it — ” harry cut across ron. “you two stay here i’ll go under the cloak and i’ll be back as soon as i — ” “no,” said hermione “it makes much more sense if i take the cloak and — ” “don’t even think about it,” ron snarled at her. before hermione could get farther than “ron i’m just as capable — ” the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open. “potter!” two masked death eaters stood there but even before their wands were fully raised hermione shouted “glisseo\” the stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she harry and ron hurtled down it unable to control their speed but so fast that the death eaters’ stunning spells flew far over their heads. they shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor hitting the opposite wall. “duro\” cried hermione pointing her wand at the tapestry and there were two loud sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the death eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. “get back!” shouted ron and he harry and hermione flattened themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past shepherded by a sprinting professor mcgonagall. she appeared not to notice them her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. as she turned the corner they heard her scream “charge!” “harry you get the cloak on,” said hermione. “never mind us — ” but he threw it over all three of them large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air the falling stone the shimmer of spells. they ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. the portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement while death eaters both masked and unmasked dueled students and teachers. dean had won himself a wand for he was face-to-face with dolohov parvati with travers. harry ron and hermione raised their wands at once ready to strike but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. even as they stood braced looking for the opportunity to act there came a great “wheeeeeeeeeeee\” and looking up harry saw peeves zooming over them dropping snargaluff pods down onto the death eaters whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. “argh!” a fistful of tubers had hit the cloak over ron’s head the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as ron tried to shake them loose. “someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked death eater pointing. dean made the most of the death eater’s momentary distraction knocking him out with a stunning spell dolohov attempted to retaliate and parvati shot a body-bind curse at him. “let’s go!” harry yelled and he ron and hermione gathered the cloak tightly around themselves and pelted heads down through the midst of the fighters slipping a little in pools of snargaluff juice toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. “i’m draco malfoy i’m draco i’m on your side!” draco was on the upper landing pleading with another masked death eater. harry stunned the death eater as they passed malfoy looked around beaming for his savior and ron punched him from under the cloak. malfoy fell backward on top of the death eater his mouth bleeding utterly bemused. “and that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight you two-faced bastard!” ron yelled. there were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall death eaters everywhere harry looked yaxley close to the front doors in combat with flitwick a masked death eater dueling kingsley right beside them. students ran in every direction some carrying or dragging injured friends. harry directed a stunning spell toward the masked death eater it missed but nearly hit neville who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of venomous tentacula which looped itself happily around the nearest death eater and began reeling him in. harry ron and hermione sped down the marble staircase glass shattered to their left and the slytherin hourglass that had recorded house points spilled its emeralds everywhere so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground and a gray blur that harry took for an animal sped four legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen. “no!” shrieked hermione and with a deafening blast from her wand fenrir greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stirring body of lavender brown. he hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. then with a bright white flash and a crack a crystal ball fell on top of his head and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. “i have more!” shrieked professor trelawney from over the banisters. “more for any who want them! here — ” and with a movement like a tennis serve she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag waved her wand through the air and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. at the same moment the heavy wooden front doors burst open and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the entrance hall. screams of terror rent the air the fighters scattered death eaters and hogwartians alike and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters which shuddered and reared more terrifying than ever. “how do we get out?” yelled ron over all the screaming but before either harry or hermione could answer they were bowled aside hagrid had come thundering down the stairs brandishing his flowery pink umbrella. “don’t hurt ’em don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled. “hagrid no!” harry forgot everything else he sprinted out from under the cloak running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. “hagrid come back!” but he was not even halfway to hagrid when he saw it happen hagrid vanished amongst the spiders and with a great scurrying a foul swarming movement they retreated under the onslaught of spells hagrid buried in their midst. “hagrid!” harry heard someone calling his own name whether friend or foe he did not care he was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds and the spiders were swarming away with their prey and he could see nothing of hagrid at all. “hagrid!” he thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm but as he made to chase after them his way was impeded by a monumental foot which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. he looked up a giant stood before him twenty feet high its head hidden in shadow nothing but its treelike hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. with one brutal fluid movement it smashed a massive fist through an upper window and glass rained down upon harry forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. “oh my — !” shrieked hermione as she and ron caught up with harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above. “dont!” ron yelled grabbing hermione’s hand as she raised her wand. “stun him and hell crush half the castle — ” “hagger?” grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle only now did harry realize that grawp was indeed an undersized giant. the gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar. the stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin and grawp ’s lopsided mouth fell open showing yellow half-brick sized teeth and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. “run!” harry roared the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled and he seized hermione’s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds ron bringing up the rear. harry had not lost hope of finding and saving hagrid he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again. the air around them had frozen harry’s breath caught and solidified in his chest. shapes moved out in the darkness swirling figures of concentrated blackness moving in a great wave toward the castle their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . . ron and hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted deadened because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night and fred was gone and hagrid was surely dying or already dead. ... “come on harry!” said hermione’s voice from a very long way away. “patronuses harry come on!” he raised his wand but a dull hopelessness was spreading through him how many more lay dead that he did not yet know about he felt as though his soul had already half left his body. . . . “harry come on!” screamed hermione. a hundred dementors were advancing gliding toward them sucking their way closer to harry’s despair which was like a promise of a feast. ... he saw ron’s silver terrier burst into the air flicker feebly and expire he saw hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade and his own wand trembled in his hand and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion the promise of nothing of no feeling. . . . and then a silver hare a boar and a fox soared past harry ron and hermione’s heads the dementors fell back before the creatures’ approach. three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them their wands outstretched continuing to cast their patronuses luna ernie and seamus. “that’s right,” said luna encouragingly as if they were back in the room of requirement and this was simply spell practice for the d.a. “that’s right harry ... come on think of something happy. ...” “something happy?” he said his voice cracked. “we’re all still here,” she whispered “we’re still fighting. come on now. ...” there was a silver spark then a wavering light and then with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of harry’s wand. it cantered forward and now the dementors scattered in earnest and immediately the night was mild again but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. “can’t thank you enough,” said ron shakily turning to luna ernie and seamus “you just saved — ” with a roar and an earth-quaking tremor another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest brandishing a club taller than any of them. “run!” harry shouted again but the others needed no telling they all scattered and not a second too soon for next moment the creature’s vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. harry looked round ron and hermione were following him but the other three had vanished back into the battle. “let’s get out of range!” yelled ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness. “the whomping willow,” said harry “go!” somehow he walled it all up in his mind crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now thoughts of fred and hagrid and his terror for all the people he loved scattered in and outside the castle must all wait because they had to run had to reach the snake and voldemort because that was as hermione said the only way to end it — he sprinted half believing he could outdistance death itself ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea and the creaking of the forbidden forest though the night was windless through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life and it was he who saw the great tree first the willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike slashing branches. panting and gasping harry slowed down skirting the willow’s swiping branches peering through the darkness toward its thick trunk trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. ron and hermione caught up hermione so out of breath she could not speak. “how — how’re we going to get in?” panted ron. “i can — see the place — if we just had — crookshanks again — ” “crookshanks?” wheezed hermione bent double clutching her chest. “are you a wizard or what?” “oh — right — yeah — ” ron looked around then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said “wingardium leviosal” the twig flew up from the ground spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind then zoomed directly at the trunk through the willow’s ominously swaying branches. it jabbed at a place near the roots and at once the writhing tree became still. “perfect!” panted hermione. “wait.” for one teetering second while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air harry hesitated. voldemort wanted him to do this wanted him to come. ... was he leading ron and hermione into a trap but then the reality seemed to close upon him cruel and plain the only way forward was to kill the snake and the snake was where voldemort was and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. ... “harry we’re coming just get in there!” said ron pushing him forward. harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. it was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. the tunnel was low-ceilinged they had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously now there was nothing for it but to crawl. harry went first his wand illuminated expecting at any moment to meet barriers but none came. they moved in silence harry’s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist. at last the tunnel began to slope upward and harry saw a sliver of light ahead. hermione tugged at his ankle. “the cloak!” she whispered. “put the cloak on!” he groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. with difficulty he dragged it over himself murmured “nox,” extinguishing his wandlight and continued on his hands and knees as silently as possible all his senses straining expecting every second to be discovered to hear a cold clear voice see a flash of green light. and then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. hardly daring to breathe harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. the room beyond was dimly lit but he could see nagini swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater safe in her enchanted starry sphere which floated unsupported in midair. he could see the edge of a table and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. then snape spoke and harry’s heart lurched snape was inches away from where he crouched hidden. ... my lord their resistance is crumbling — ” “ — and it is doing so without your help,” said voldemort in his high clear voice. “skilled wizard though you are severus i do not think you will make much difference now. we are almost there ... almost.” “let me find the boy. let me bring you potter. i know i can find him my lord. please.” snape strode past the gap and harry drew back a little keeping his eyes fixed upon nagini wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her but he could not think of anything. one failed attempt and he would give away his position. ... voldemort stood up. harry could see him now see the red eyes the flattened serpentine face the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. “i have a problem severus,” said voldemort softly. “my lord?” said snape. voldemort raised the elder wand holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor’s baton. “why doesn’t it work for me severus?” in the silence harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled — or was it voldemort’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air “my — my lord?” said snape blankly. “i do not understand. you — you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.” “no,” said voldemort. “i have performed my usual magic. i am extraordinary but this wand ... no. it has not revealed the wonders it has promised. i feel no difference between this wand and the one i procured from ollivander all those years ago.” voldemort’s tone was musing calm but harry’s scar had begun to throb and pulse pain was building in his forehead and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside voldemort. “no difference,” said voldemort again. snape did not speak. harry could not see his face he wondered whether snape sensed danger was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. voldemort started to move around the room harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled speaking in that same measured voice while the pain and fury mounted in harry. “i have thought long and hard severus. ... do you know why i have called you back from the battle?” and for a moment harry saw snape ’s profile his eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage. “no my lord but i beg you will let me return. let me find potter.” “you sound like lucius. neither of you understands potter as i do. he does not need finding. potter will come to me. i know his weakness you see his one great flaw. he will hate watching the others struck down around him knowing that it is for him that it happens. he will want to stop it at any cost. he will come.” “but my lord he might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself — ” “my instructions to my death eaters have been perfectly clear. capture potter. kill his friends — the more the better — but do not kill him. “but it is of you that i wished to speak severus not harry potter. you have been very valuable to me. very valuable.” “my lord knows i seek only to serve him. but — let me go and find the boy my lord. let me bring him to you. i know i can — ” “i have told you no!” said voldemort and harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake and he felt voldemort’s impatience in his burning scar. “my concern at the moment severus is what will happen when i finally meet the boy!” “my lord there can be no question surely — ” “ — but there is a question severus. there is.” voldemort halted and harry could see him plainly again as he slid the elder wand through his white fingers staring at snape. “why did both the wands i have used fail when directed at harry potter?” “i — i cannot answer that my lord.” “can’t you?” the stab of rage felt like a spike driven through harry’s head he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. he closed his eyes and suddenly he was voldemort looking into snape’s pale face. “my wand of yew did everything of which i asked it severus except to kill harry potter. twice it failed. ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores told me to take another’s wand. i did so but lucius’s wand shattered upon meeting potter’s.” “i — i have no explanation my lord.” snape was not looking at voldemort now. his dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. “i sought a third wand severus. the elder wand the wand of destiny the deathstick. i took it from its previous master. i took it from the grave of albus dumbledore.” and now snape looked at voldemort and snape’s face was like a death mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. “my lord — let me go to the boy — ” “all this long night when i am on the brink of victory i have sat here,” said voldemort his voice barely louder than a whisper “wondering wondering why the elder wand refuses to be what it ought to be refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner ... and i think i have the answer.” snape did not speak. “perhaps you already know it you are a clever man after all severus. you have been a good and faithful servant and i regret what must happen.” “my lord — ” “the elder wand cannot serve me properly severus because i am not its true master. the elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. you killed albus dumbledore. while you live severus the elder wand cannot be truly mine.” “my lord!” snape protested raising his wand. “it cannot be any other way,” said voldemort. “i must master the wand severus. master the wand and i master potter at last.” and voldemort swiped the air with the elder wand. it did nothing to snape who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved but then voldemort’s intention became clear. the snake’s cage was rolling through the air and before snape could do anything more than yell it had encased him head and shoulders and voldemort spoke in parseltongue. “kill.” there was a terrible scream. harry saw snape ’s face losing the little color it had left it whitened as his black eyes widened as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. “i regret it,” said voldemort coldly. he turned away there was no sadness in him no remorse. it was time to leave this shack and take charge with a wand that would now do his full bidding. he pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake which drifted upward off snape who fell sideways onto the floor blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. back in the tunnel and his own mind harry opened his eyes he had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out. now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. “harry!” breathed hermione behind him but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. it lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. as quietly as he could he pulled himself up into the room. he did not know why he was doing it why he was approaching the dying man he did not know what he felt as he saw snape’s white face and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated whose widening black eyes found harry as he tried to speak. harry bent over him and snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close. a terrible rasping gurgling noise issued from snape’s throat. “take ... it. ... take ... it. ...” something more than blood was leaking from snape. silvery blue neither gas nor liquid it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes and harry knew what it was but did not know what to do — a flask conjured from thin air was thrust into his shaking hands by hermione. harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. when the flask was full to the brim and snape looked as though there was no blood left in him his grip on harry’s robes slackened. “look ... at ... me. ...” he whispered. the green eyes found the black but after a second something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish leaving them fixed blank and empty. the hand holding harry thudded to the floor and snape moved no more. the prince’s tale harry remained kneeling at snape’s side simply staring down at him until quite suddenly a high cold voice spoke so close to them that harry jumped to his feet the flask gripped tightly in his hands thinking that voldemort had reentered the room. voldemort ’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor and harry realized that he was talking to hogwarts and to all the surrounding area that the residents of hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them his breath on the back of their necks a deathblow away. “you have fought,” said the high cold voice “valiantly. lord voldemort knows how to value bravery. “yet you have sustained heavy losses. if you continue to resist me you will all die one by one. i do not wish this to happen. every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. “lord voldemort is merciful. i command my forces to retreat immediately. “you have one hour. dispose of your dead with dignity. treat your injured. “i speak now harry potter directly to you. you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest. if at the end of that hour you have not come to me have not given yourself up then battle recommences. this time i shall enter the fray myself harry potter and i shall find you and i shall punish every last man woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me. one hour.” both ron and hermione shook their heads frantically looking at harry. “don’t listen to him,” said ron. “it’ll be all right,” said hermione wildly. “let’s — let’s get back to the castle if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new plan — ” she glanced at snape’s body then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. ron followed her. harry gathered up the invisibility cloak then looked down at snape. he did not know what to feel except shock at the way snape had been killed and the reason for which it had been done. ... they crawled back through the tunnel none of them talking and harry wondered whether ron and hermione could still hear voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest. . . . one hour. . . . small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. it could only be an hour or so from dawn yet it was pitch-black. the three of them hurried toward the stone steps. a lone clog the size of a small boat lay abandoned in front of them. there was no other sign of grawp or of his attacker. the castle was unnaturally silent. there were no flashes of light now no bangs or screams or shouts. the flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. emeralds were still scattered all over the floor along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. part of the banisters had been blown away. “where is everyone?” whispered hermione. ron led the way to the great hall. harry stopped in the doorway. the house tables were gone and the room was crowded. the survivors stood in groups their arms around each other’s necks. the injured were being treated upon the raised platform by madam pomfrey and a group of helpers. firenze was amongst the injured his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay unable to stand. the dead lay in a row in the middle of the hall. harry could not see fred’s body because his family surrounded him. george was kneeling at his head mrs. weasley was lying across fred’s chest her body shaking mr. weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks. without a word to harry ron and hermione walked away. harry saw hermione approach ginny whose face was swollen and blotchy and hug her. ron joined bill fleur and percy who flung an arm around ron’s shoulders. as ginny and hermione moved closer to the rest of the family harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to fred remus and tonks pale and still and peaceful-looking apparently asleep beneath the dark enchanted ceiling. the great hall seemed to fly away become smaller shrink as harry reeled backward from the doorway. he could not draw breath. he could not bear to look at any of the other bodies to see who else had died for him. he could not bear to join the weasleys could not look into their eyes when if he had given himself up in the first place fred might never have died. ... he turned away and ran up the marble staircase. lupin tonks ... he yearned not to feel. ... he wished he could rip out his heart his innards everything that was screaming inside him. ... the castle was completely empty even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the great hall. harry ran without stopping clutching the crystal flask of snape’s last thoughts and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office. “password?” “dumbledore!” said harry without thinking because it was he whom he yearned to see and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. but when harry burst into the circular office he found a change. the portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him all it seemed had flitted away charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. harry glanced hopelessly at dumbledore’s deserted frame which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair then turned his back on it. the stone pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been harry heaved it onto the desk and poured snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. to escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief. ... nothing that even snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. the memories swirled silver white and strange and without hesitating with a feeling of reckless abandonment as though this would assuage his torturing grief harry dived. he fell headlong into sunlight and his feet found warm ground. when he straightened up he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. a single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. two girls were swinging backward and forward and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. his black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate too short jeans a shabby overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man an odd smocklike shirt. harry moved closer to the boy. snape looked no more than nine or ten years old sallow small stringy. there was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. “lily don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two. but the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air quite literally flown launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt she soared like a trapeze artist through the air staying up far too long landing far too lightly. “mummy told you not to!” petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground making a crunching grinding sound then leapt up hands on hips. “mummy said you weren’t allowed lily!” “but i’m fine,” said lily still giggling. “tuney look at this. watch what i can do.” petunia glanced around. the playground was deserted apart from themselves and though the girls did not know it snape. lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which snape lurked. petunia advanced evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. lily waited until petunia was near enough to have a clear view then held out her palm. the flower sat there opening and closing its petals like some bizarre many-lipped oyster. “stop it!” shrieked petunia. “it’s not hurting you,” said lily but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground. “it’s not right,” said petunia but her eyes had followed the flower’s flight to the ground and lingered upon it. “how do you do it?” she added and there was definite longing in her voice. “it’s obvious isn’t it?” snape could no longer contain himself but had jumped out from behind the bushes. petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings but lily though clearly startled remained where she was. snape seemed to regret his appearance. a dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at lily. “what’s obvious?” asked lily. snape had an air of nervous excitement. with a glance at the distant petunia now hovering beside the swings he lowered his voice and said “i know what you are.” “what do you mean?” “you’re ... you’re a witch,” whispered snape. she looked affronted. “ that’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!” she turned nose in the air and marched off toward her sister. “no!” said snape. he was highly colored now and harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. he flapped after the girls looking ludicrously batlike like his older self. the sisters considered him united in disapproval both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag. “you are,” said snape to lily. “you are a witch. i’ve been watching you for a while. but there’s nothing wrong with that. my mum’s one and i’m a wizard.” petunia’s laugh was like cold water. “wizard!” she shrieked her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. “i know who you are. you’re that snape boy! they live down spinner’s end by the river,” she told lily and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. “why have you been spying on us?” “haven’t been spying,” said snape hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. “wouldn’t spy on you anyway,” he added spitefully “ you’re a muggle.” though petunia evidently did not understand the word she could hardly mistake the tone. “lily come on we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. lily obeyed her sister at once glaring at snape as she left. he stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate and harry the only one left to observe him recognized snape ’s bitter disappointment and understood that snape had been planning this moment for a while and that it had all gone wrong. . . . the scene dissolved and before harry knew it re formed around him. he was now in a small thicket of trees. he could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. the shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. two children sat facing each other cross-legged on the ground. snape had removed his coat now his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light. ... and the ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school you get letters.” “but i have done magic outside school!” “we’re all right. we haven’t got wands yet. they let you off when you’re a kid and you can’t help it. but once you’re eleven,” he nodded importantly “and they start training you then you’ve got to go careful.” there was a little silence. lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air and harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. then she dropped the twig leaned in toward the boy and said “it is real isn’t it it’s not a joke petunia says you’re lying to me. petunia says there isn’t a hogwarts. it is real isn’t it?” “it’s real for us,” said snape. “not for her. but we’ll get the letter you and me.” “really?” whispered lily. “definitely,” said snape and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her brimful of confidence in his destiny. “and will it really come by owl?” lily whispered. “normally,” said snape. “but you’re muggle-born so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.” “does it make a difference being muggle-born?” snape hesitated. his black eyes eager in the greenish gloom moved over the pale face the dark red hair. “no,” he said. “it doesn’t make any difference.” “good,” said lily relaxing it was clear that she had been worrying. “you’ve got loads of magic,” said snape. “i saw that. all the time i was watching you ...” his voice trailed away she was not listening but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. he watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground. “how are things at your house?” lily asked. a little crease appeared between his eyes. “fine,” he said. “they’re not arguing anymore?” “oh yes they’re arguing,” said snape. he picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart apparently unaware of what he was doing. “but it won’t be that long and i’ll be gone.” “doesn’t your dad like magic?” “he doesn’t like anything much,” said snape. “severus?” a little smile twisted snape ’s mouth when she said his name. “yeah?” “tell me about the dementors again.” “what d’you want to know about them for?” “if i use magic outside school — ” “they wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. they guard the wizard prison azkaban. you’re not going to end up in azkaban you’re too — ” he turned red again and shredded more leaves. then a small rustling noise behind harry made him turn petunia hiding behind a tree had lost her footing. “tuney!” said lily surprise and welcome in her voice but snape had jumped to his feet. “who’s spying now?” he shouted. “what d’you want?” petunia was breathless alarmed at being caught. harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say. “what is that you’re wearing anyway?” she said pointing at snape’s chest. “your mum’s blouse?” there was a crack a branch over petunia’s head had fallen. lily screamed the branch caught petunia on the shoulder and she staggered backward and burst into tears. “tuney!” but petunia was running away. lily rounded on snape. “did you make that happen?” “no.” he looked both defiant and scared. “you did!” she was backing away from him. “you did). you hurt her!” “no — no i didn’t!” but the lie did not convince lily after one last burning look she ran from the little thicket off after her sister and snape looked miserable and confused. and the scene re-formed. harry looked around he was on platform nine and three-quarters and snape stood beside him slightly hunched next to a thin sallow-faced sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. the two girls stood a little apart from their parents. lily seemed to be pleading with her sister harry moved closer to listen. ... i’m sorry tuney i’m sorry! listen — ” she caught her sister’s hand and held tight to it even though petunia tried to pull it away. “maybe once i’m there — no listen tuney! maybe once i’m there i’ll be able to go to professor dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!” “i don’t — want — to — go!” said petunia and she dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp. “you think i want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a — a — ” her pale eyes roved over the platform over the cats mewling in their owners’ arms over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages over the students some already in their long black robes loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. “ — you think i want to be a — a freak?” lily’s eyes filled with tears as petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. “i’m not a freak,” said lily. “that’s a horrible thing to say.” “that’s where you’re going,” said petunia with relish. “a special school for freaks. you and that snape boy ... weirdos that’s what you two are. it’s good you’re being separated from normal people. it’s for our safety.” lily glanced toward her parents who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment drinking in the scene. then she looked back at her sister and her voice was low and fierce. “you didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.” petunia turned scarlet. “beg i didn’t beg!” “i saw his reply. it was very kind.” “you shouldn’t have read — ” whispered petunia “that was my private — how could you — ” lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where snape stood nearby. petunia gasped. “that boy found it! you and that boy have been sneaking in my room!” “no — not sneaking — ” now lily was on the defensive. “severus saw the envelope and he couldn’t believe a muggle could have contacted hogwarts that’s all! he says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of — ” “apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said petunia now as pale as she had been flushed. “ freak).” she spat at her sister and she flounced off to where her parents stood. ... the scene dissolved again. snape was hurrying along the corridor of the hogwarts express as it clattered through the countryside. he had already changed into his school robes had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful muggle clothes. at last he stopped outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. hunched in a corner seat beside the window was lily her face pressed against the windowpane. snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite lily. she glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. she had been crying. “i don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice. “why not?” “tuney h-hates me. because we saw that letter from dumbledore.” “so what?” she threw him a look of deep dislike. “so she’s my sister!” “she’s only a — ” he caught himself quickly lily too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed did not hear him. “but we’re going!” he said unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. “this is it! we’re off to hogwarts!” she nodded mopping her eyes but in spite of herself she half smiled. “you’d better be in slytherin,” said snape encouraged that she had brightened a little. “slytherin?” one of the boys sharing the compartment who had shown no interest at all in lily or snape until that point looked around at the word and harry whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window saw his father slight black-haired like snape but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for even adored that snape so conspicuously lacked. “who wants to be in slytherin i think i’d leave wouldn’t you?” james asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him and with a jolt harry realized that it was sirius. sirius did not smile. “my whole family have been in slytherin,” he said. “blimey,” said james “and i thought you seemed all right!” sirius grinned. “maybe i’ll break the tradition. where are you heading if you’ve got the choice?” james lifted an invisible sword. “ ‘gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart!’ like my dad.” snape made a small disparaging noise. james turned on him. “got a problem with that?” “no,” said snape though his slight sneer said otherwise. “if you’d rather be brawny than brainy — ” “where ’re you hoping to go seeing as you’re neither?” interjected sirius. james roared with laughter. lily sat up rather flushed and looked from james to sirius in dislike. “come on severus let’s find another compartment.” “oooooo ...” james and sirius imitated her lofty voice james tried to trip snape as he passed. “see ya snivellus!” a voice called as the compartment door slammed. ... and the scene dissolved once more. ... harry was standing right behind snape as they faced the candlelit house tables lined with rapt faces. then professor mcgonagall said “evans lily!” he watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. professor mcgonagall dropped the sorting hat onto her head and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair the hat cried “ gryffindoii” harry heard snape let out a tiny groan. lily took off the hat handed it back to professor mcgonagall then hurried toward the cheering gryffindors but as she went she glanced back at snape and there was a sad little smile on her face. harry saw sirius move up the bench to make room for her. she took one look at him seemed to recognize him from the train folded her arms and firmly turned her back on him. the roll call continued. harry watched lupin pettigrew and his father join lily and sirius at the gryffindor table. at last when only a dozen students remained to be sorted professor mcgonagall called snape. harry walked with him to the stool watched him place the hat upon his head. “slytherinl” cried the sorting hat. and severus snape moved off to the other side of the hall away from lily to where the slytherins were cheering him to where lucius malfoy a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest patted snape on the back as he sat down beside him. ... and the scene changed. ... lily and snape were walking across the castle courtyard evidently arguing. harry hurried to catch up with them to listen in. as he reached them he realized how much taller they both were a few years seemed to have passed since their sorting. ... thought we were supposed to be friends?” snape was saying. “best friends?” “we are sev but i don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round with! i’m sorry but i detest avery and mulciber! mulciber what do you see in him sev he’s creepy! d’you know what he tried to do to mary macdonald the other day?” lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it looking up into the thin sallow face. “that was nothing,” said snape. “it was a laugh that’s all — ” “it was dark magic and if you think that’s funny — ” “what about the stuff potter and his mates get up to?” demanded snape. his color rose again as he said it unable it seemed to hold in his resentment. “what’s potter got to do with anything?” said lily. “they sneak out at night. there’s something weird about that lupin. where does he keep going?” “he’s ill,” said lily. “they say he’s ill — ” “every month at the full moon?” said snape. “i know your theory,” said lily and she sounded cold. “why are you so obsessed with them anyway why do you care what they’re doing at night?” “i’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.” the intensity of his gaze made her blush. “they don’t use dark magic though.” she dropped her voice. “and you’re being really ungrateful. i heard what happened the other night. you went sneaking down that tunnel by the whomping willow and james potter saved you from whatever’s down there snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered “saved saved you think he was playing the hero he was saving his neck and his friends’ too! you’re not going to — i won’t let you — ” “let me let me?” lily’s bright green eyes were slits. snape backtracked at once. “i didn’t mean — i just don’t want to see you made a fool of — he fancies you james potter fancies you!” the words seemed wrenched from him against his will. “and he’s not ... everyone thinks ... big quidditch hero — ” snape’s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent and lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. “i know james potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said cutting across snape. “i don’t need you to tell me that. but mulciber’s and avery’s idea of humor is just evil. evil sev. i don’t understand how you can be friends with them.” harry doubted that snape had even heard her strictures on mulciber and avery. the moment she had insulted james potter his whole body had relaxed and as they walked away there was a new spring in snape’s step. ... and the scene dissolved. ... harry watched again as snape left the great hall after sitting his o.w.l. in defense against the dark arts watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where james sirius lupin and pettigrew sat together. but harry kept his distance this time because he knew what happened after james had hoisted severus into the air and taunted him he knew what had been done and said and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again. ... he watched as lily joined the group and went to snape’s defense. distantly he heard snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury the unforgivable word “mudbloocl.” the scene changed. ... “i’m sorry.” “i’m not interested.” “i’m sorry!” “save your breath.” it was nighttime. lily who was wearing a dressing gown stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the fat lady at the entrance to gryffindor tower. “i only came out because mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.” “i was. i would have done. i never meant to call you mudblood it just — ” “slipped out?” there was no pity in lily’s voice. “it’s too late. i’ve made excuses for you for years. none of my friends can understand why i even talk to you. you and your precious little death eater friends — you see you don’t even deny it! you don’t even deny that’s what you’re all aiming to be! you can’t wait to join you know who can you?” he opened his mouth but closed it without speaking. “i can’t pretend anymore. you’ve chosen your way i’ve chosen mine.” “no — listen i didn’t mean — ” “ — to call me mudblood but you call everyone of my birth mudblood severus. why should i be any different?” he struggled on the verge of speech but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. ... the corridor dissolved and the scene took a little longer to reform harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop forlorn and cold in the darkness the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. the adult snape was panting turning on the spot his wand gripped tightly in his hand waiting for something or for someone. ... his fear infected harry too even though he knew that he could not be harmed and he looked over his shoulder wondering what it was that snape was waiting for — then a blinding jagged jet of white light flew through the air harry thought of lightning but snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand. “don’t kill me!” “that was not my intention.” any sound of dumbledore apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. he stood before snape with his robes whipping around him and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand. “well severus what message does lord voldemort have for me?” “no — no message — i’m here on my own account!” snape was wringing his hands he looked a little mad with his straggling black hair flying around him. “i — i come with a warning — no a request — please dumbledore flicked his wand. though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them silence fell on the spot where he and snape faced each other. “what request could a death eater make of me?” “the — the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . trelawney “ah yes,” said dumbledore. “how much did you relay to lord voldemort?” “everything — everything i heard!” said snape. “that is why — it is for that reason — he thinks it means lily evans!” “the prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said dumbledore. “it spoke of a boy born at the end of july — ” “you know what i mean! he thinks it means her son he is going to hunt her down — kill them all — ” “if she means so much to you,” said dumbledore “surely lord voldemort will spare her could you not ask for mercy for the mother in exchange for the son?” “i have — i have asked him — ” “you disgust me,” said dumbledore and harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. snape seemed to shrink a little. “you do not care then about the deaths of her husband and child they can die as long as you have what you want?” snape said nothing but merely looked up at dumbledore. “hide them all then,” he croaked. “keep her — them — safe. please.” “and what will you give me in return severus?” “in — in return?” snape gaped at dumbledore and harry expected him to protest but after a long moment he said “anything.” the hilltop faded and harry stood in dumbledore’s office and something was making a terrible sound like a wounded animal. snape was slumped forward in a chair and dumbledore was standing over him looking grim. after a moment or two snape raised his face and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. “i thought ... you were going ... to keep her ... safe. “she and james put their faith in the wrong person,” said dumbledore. “rather like you severus. weren’t you hoping that lord voldemort would spare her?” snape’s breathing was shallow. “her boy survives,” said dumbledore. with a tiny jerk of the head snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. “her son lives. he has her eyes precisely her eyes. you remember the shape and color of lily evans’s eyes i am sure?” “don’t!” bellowed snape. “gone ... dead ...” “is this remorse severus?” “i wish ... i wish were dead. ...” “and what use would that be to anyone?” said dumbledore coldly. “if you loved lily evans if you truly loved her then your way forward is clear.” snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain and dumbledore ’s words appeared to take a long time to reach him. “what — what do you mean?” “you know how and why she died. make sure it was not in vain. help me protect lily’s son.” “he does not need protection. the dark lord has gone “the dark lord will return and harry potter will be in terrible danger when he does.” there was a long pause and slowly snape regained control of himself mastered his own breathing. at last he said “very well. very well. but never — never tell dumbledore! this must be between us! swear it! i cannot bear . . . especially potter’s son ... i want your word!” “my word severus that i shall never reveal the best of you?” dumbledore sighed looking down into snape’s ferocious anguished face. “if you insist ...” the office dissolved but re-formed instantly. snape was pacing up and down in front of dumbledore. “ — mediocre arrogant as his father a determined rule-breaker delighted to find himself famous attention-seeking and impertinent — ” “you see what you expect to see severus,” said dumbledore without raising his eyes from a copy of transfiguration today. “other teachers report that the boy is modest likable and reasonably talented. personally i find him an engaging child.” dumbledore turned a page and said without looking up “keep an eye on quirrell won’t you?” a whirl of color and now everything darkened and snape and dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall while the last stragglers from the yule ball passed them on their way to bed. “well?” murmured dumbledore. “karkaroff’s mark is becoming darker too. he is panicking he fears retribution you know how much help he gave the ministry after the dark lord fell.” snape looked sideways at dumbledore ’s crooked nosed profile. “karkaroff intends to flee if the mark burns.” “does he?” said dumbledore softly as fleur delacour and roger davies came giggling in from the grounds. “and are you tempted to join him?” “no,” said snape his black eyes on fleur’s and roger’s retreating figures. “i am not such a coward.” “no,” agreed dumbledore. “you are a braver man by far than igor karkaroff. you know i sometimes think we sort too soon. ...” he walked away leaving snape looking stricken. ... and now harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet again. it was nighttime and dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk apparently semiconscious. his right hand dangled over the side blackened and burned. snape was muttering incantations pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down dumbledore ’s throat. after a moment or two dumbledore ’s eyelids fluttered and opened. “why,” said snape without preamble “ why did you put on that ring it carries a curse surely you realized that. why even touch it?” marvolo gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before dumbledore. it was cracked the sword of gryffindor lay beside it. dumbledore grimaced. “i ... was a fool. sorely tempted ...” “tempted by what?” dumbledore did not answer. “it is a miracle you managed to return here!” snape sounded furious. “that ring carried a curse of extraordinary power to contain it is all we can hope for i have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being — ” dumbledore raised his blackened useless hand and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio. “you have done very well severus. how long do you think i have?” dumbledore ’s tone was conversational he might have been asking for a weather forecast. snape hesitated and then said “i cannot tell. maybe a year. there is no halting such a spell forever. it will spread eventually it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.” dumbledore smiled. the news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him. “i am fortunate extremely fortunate that i have you severus.” “if you had only summoned me a little earlier i might have been able to do more buy you more time!” said snape furiously. he looked down at the broken ring and the sword. “did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?” “something like that ... i was delirious no doubt. ...” said dumbledore. with an effort he straightened himself in his chair. “well really this makes matters much more straightforward.” snape looked utterly perplexed. dumbledore smiled. “i refer to the plan lord voldemort is revolving around me. his plan to have the poor malfoy boy murder me.” snape sat down in the chair harry had so often occupied across the desk from dumbledore. harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of dumbledore ’s cursed hand but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. scowling snape said “the dark lord does not expect draco to succeed. this is merely punishment for lucius’s recent failures. slow torture for draco’s parents while they watch him fail and pay the price.” “in short the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as i have,” said dumbledore. “now i should have thought the natural successor to the job once draco fails is yourself?” there was a short pause. “that i think is the dark lord’s plan.” “lord voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at hogwarts?” “he believes the school will soon be in his grasp yes.” “and if it does fall into his grasp,” said dumbledore almost it seemed as an aside “i have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of hogwarts?” snape gave a stiff nod. “good. now then. your first priority will be to discover what draco is up to. a frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. offer him help and guidance he ought to accept he likes you — ” “ — much less since his father has lost favor. draco blames me he thinks i have usurped lucius’s position.” “all the same try. i am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. ultimately of course there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from lord voldemort’s wrath.” snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked “are you intending to let him kill you?” “certainly not. you must kill me.” there was a long silence broken only by an odd clicking noise. fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone. “would you like me to do it now?” asked snape his voice heavy with irony. “or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?” “oh not quite yet,” said dumbledore smiling. “i daresay the moment will present itself in due course. given what has happened tonight,” he indicated his withered hand “we can be sure that it will happen within a year.” “if you don’t mind dying,” said snape roughly “why not let draco do it?” “that boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said dumbledore. “i would not have it ripped apart on my account.” “and my soul dumbledore mine?” “you alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,” said dumbledore. “i ask this one great favor of you severus because death is coming for me as surely as the chudley cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league. i confess i should prefer a quick painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if for instance greyback is involved — i hear voldemort has recruited him or dear bellatrix who likes to play with her food before she eats it.” his tone was light but his blue eyes pierced snape as they had frequently pierced harry as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. at last snape gave another curt nod. dumbledore seemed satisfied. “thank you severus ...” the office disappeared and now snape and dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight. “what are you doing with potter all these evenings you are closeted together?” snape asked abruptly. dumbledore looked weary. “why you aren’t trying to give him more detentions severus the boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.” “he is his father over again — ” “in looks perhaps but his deepest nature is much more like his mother’s. i spend time with harry because i have things to discuss with him information i must give him before it is too late.” “information,” repeated snape. “you trust him ... you do not trust me.” “it is not a question of trust. i have as we both know limited time. it is essential that i give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.” “and why may i not have the same information?” “i prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of lord voldemort.” “which i do on your orders!” “and you do it extremely well. do not think that i underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself severus. to give voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job i would entrust to nobody but you.” “yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of occlumency whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the dark lord’s mind!” “voldemort fears that connection,” said dumbledore. “not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing harry’s mind means to him. it was pain such as he has never experienced. he will not try to possess harry again i am sure of it. not in that way.” “i don’t understand.” “lord voldemort’s soul maimed as it is cannot bear close contact with a soul like harry’s. like a tongue on frozen steel like flesh in flame — ” “souls we were talking of minds!” “in the case of harry and lord voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other.” dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. they were close by the forbidden forest now but there was no sign of anyone near them. “after you have killed me severus — ” “you refuse to tell me everything yet you expect that small service of me!” snarled snape and real anger flared in the thin face now. “you take a great deal for granted dumbledore! perhaps i have changed my mind!” “you gave me your word severus. and while we are talking about services you owe me i thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young slytherin friend?” snape looked angry mutinous. dumbledore sighed. “come to my office tonight severus at eleven and you shall not complain that i have no confidence in you. ...” they were back in dumbledore ’s office the windows dark and fawkes sat silent as snape sat quite still as dumbledore walked around him talking. “harry must not know not until the last moment not until it is necessary otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?” “but what must he do?” “that is between harry and me. now listen closely severus. there will come a time — after my death — do not argue do not interrupt! there will come a time when lord voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.” “for nagini?” snape looked astonished. “precisely. if there comes a time when lord voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection then i think it will be safe to tell harry.” “tell him what?” dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. “tell him that on the night lord voldemort tried to kill him when lily cast her own life between them as a shield the killing curse rebounded upon lord voldemort and a fragment of voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building. part of lord voldemort lives inside harry and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes and a connection with lord voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. and while that fragment of soul unmissed by voldemort remains attached to and protected by harry lord voldemort cannot die.” harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel they were so far away from him their voices echoing strangely in his ears. “so the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked snape quite calmly. “and voldemort himself must do it severus. that is essential.” another long silence. then snape said “i thought ... all these years . . . that we were protecting him for her. for lily.” “we have protected him because it has been essential to teach him to raise him to let him try his strength,” said dumbledore his eyes still tight shut. “meanwhile the connection between them grows ever stronger a parasitic growth sometimes i have thought he suspects it himself. if i know him he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death it will truly mean the end of voldemort.” dumbledore opened his eyes. snape looked horrified. “you have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?” “don’t be shocked severus. how many men and women have you watched die?” “lately only those whom i could not save,” said snape. he stood up. “you have used me.” “meaning?” “i have spied for you and lied for you put myself in mortal danger for you. everything was supposed to be to keep lily potter’s son safe. now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter — ” “but this is touching severus,” said dumbledore seriously. “have you grown to care for the boy after all?” “for him?” shouted snape. “expecto patronuml” from the tip of his wand burst the silver doe she landed on the office floor bounded once across the office and soared out of the window. dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears. “after all this time?” “always,” said snape. and the scene shifted. now harry saw snape talking to the portrait of dumbledore behind his desk. “you will have to give voldemort the correct date of harry’s departure from his aunt and uncle’s,” said dumbledore. “not to do so will raise suspicion when voldemort believes you so well informed. however you must plant the idea of decoys that i think ought to ensure harry’s safety. try confunding mundungus fletcher. and severus if you are forced to take part in the chase be sure to act your part convincingly. ... i am counting upon you to remain in lord voldemort’s good books as long as possible or hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the carrows. ...” now snape was head to head with mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern mundungus ’s face looking curiously blank snape frowning in concentration. “you will suggest to the order of the phoenix,” snape murmured “that they use decoys. polyjuice potion. identical potters. it is the only thing that might work. you will forget that i have suggested this. you will present it as your own idea. you understand?” “i understand,” murmured mundungus his eyes unfocused. ... now harry was flying alongside snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night he was accompanied by other hooded death eaters and ahead were lupin and a harry who was really george. ... a death eater moved ahead of snape and raised his wand pointing it directly at lupin’s back — “ sectumsemprcd” shouted snape. but the spell intended for the death eater’s wand hand missed and hit george instead — and next snape was kneeling in sirius’s old bedroom. tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from lily. the second page carried only a few words could ever have been friends with gellert grindelwald. i think her mind’s going personally! lots of love lily snape took the page bearing lily’s signature and her love and tucked it inside his robes. then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding so that he kept the part from which lily laughed throwing the portion showing james and harry back onto the floor under the chest of drawers. ... and now snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as phineas nigellus came hurrying into his portrait. “headmaster! they are camping in the forest of dean! the mudblood — ” “do not use that word!” “ — the granger girl then mentioned the place as she opened her bag and i heard her!” “good. very good!” cried the portrait of dumbledore behind the headmaster’s chair. “now severus the sword! do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must not know that you give it! if voldemort should read harry’s mind and see you acting for him — ” “i know,” said snape curtly. he approached the portrait of dumbledore and pulled at its side. it swung forward revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of gryffindor. “and you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give potter the sword?” said snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. “no i don’t think so,” said dumbledore’s portrait. “he will know what to do with it. and severus be very careful they may not take kindly to your appearance after george weasley’s mishap — ” snape turned at the door. “don’t worry dumbledore,” he said coolly. “i have a plan. ...” and snape left the room. harry rose up out of the pensieve and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room snape might just have closed the door. the forest again finally the truth. lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. his job was to walk calmly into death’s welcoming arms. along the way he was to dispose of voldemort’s remaining links to life so that when at last he flung himself across voldemort’s path and did not raise a wand to defend himself the end would be clean and the job that ought to have been done in godric’s hollow would be finished neither would live neither could survive. he felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. how strange that in his dread of death it pumped all the harder valiantly keeping him alive. but it would have to stop and soon. its beats were numbered. how many would there be time for as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time out into the grounds and into the forest terror washed over him as he lay on the floor with that funeral drum pounding inside him. would it hurt to die all those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped he had never really thought of the thing itself his will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape to outrun voldemort. it was over he knew it and all that was left was the thing itself dying. if he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had left number four privet drive for the last time when the noble phoenix-feather wand had saved him! if he could only have died like hedwig so quickly he would not have known it had happened! or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved. ... he envied even his parents’ deaths now. this cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. he felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them although no one could see him the portraits on the walls were all empty. slowly very slowly he sat up and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was brain and nerve and bounding heart it would all be gone ... or at least he would be gone from it. his breath came slow and deep and his mouth and throat were completely dry but so were his eyes. dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. of course there had been a bigger plan harry had simply been too foolish to see it he realized that now. he had never questioned his own assumption that dumbledore wanted him alive. now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the horcruxes. dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only voldemort but himself to life! how neat how elegant not to waste any more lives but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter and whose death would not be a calamity but another blow against voldemort. and dumbledore had known that harry would not duck out that he would keep going to the end even though it was his end because he had taken trouble to get to know him hadn’t he dumbledore knew as voldemort knew that harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. the images of fred lupin and tonks lying dead in the great hall forced their way back into his mind’s eye and for a moment he could hardly breathe death was impatient. ... but dumbledore had overestimated him. he had failed the snake survived. one horcrux remained to bind voldemort to the earth even after harry had been killed. true that would mean an easier job for somebody. he wondered who would do it. ... ron and hermione would know what needed to be done of course. ... that would have been why dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others ... so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early they could carry on. ... like rain on a cold window these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth which was that he must die. i must die. it must end. ron and hermione seemed a long way away in a far off country he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. there would be no good-byes and no explanations he was determined of that. this was a journey they could not take together and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. he looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. nearly half of the hour allotted by voldemort for his surrender had elapsed. he stood up. his heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. perhaps it knew it had little time left perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime’s beats before the end. he did not look back as he closed the office door. the castle was empty. he felt ghostly striding through it alone as if he had already died. the portrait people were still missing from their frames the whole place was eerily still as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the great hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed. harry pulled the invisibility cloak over himself and descended through the floors at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed to be seen to be stopped but the cloak was as ever impenetrable perfect and he reached the front doors easily. then neville nearly walked into him. he was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach colin creevey though underage must have sneaked back just as malfoy crabbe and goyle had done. he was tiny in death. “you know what i can manage him alone neville,” said oliver wood and he heaved colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him into the great hall. neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. he looked like an old man. then he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies. harry took one glance back at the entrance of the great hall. people were moving around trying to comfort each other drinking kneeling beside the dead but he could not see any of the people he loved no hint of hermione ron ginny or any of the other weasleys no luna. he felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them but then would he ever have the strength to stop looking it was better like this. he moved down the steps and out into the darkness. it was nearly four in the morning and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath waiting to see whether he could do what he must. harry moved toward neville who was bending over another body. “neville.” “blimey harry you nearly gave me heart failure!” harry had pulled off the cloak the idea had come to him out of nowhere born out of a desire to make absolutely sure. “where are you going alone?” neville asked suspiciously. “it’s all part of the plan,” said harry. “there’s something i’ve got to do. listen — neville — ” “harry!” neville looked suddenly scared. “harry you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?” “no,” harry lied easily. “ ’course not ... this is something else. but i might be out of sight for a while. you know voldemort’s snake neville he’s got a huge snake. ... calls it nagini ...” “i’ve heard yeah. ... what about it?” “it’s got to be killed. ron and hermione know that but just in case they — ” the awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment made it impossible to keep talking. but he pulled himself together again this was crucial he must be like dumbledore keep a cool head make sure there were backups others to carry on. dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the horcruxes now neville would take harry’s place there would still be three in the secret. “just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance — ” “kill the snake?” “kill the snake,” harry repeated. “all right harry. you’re okay are you?” “i’m fine. thanks neville.” but neville seized his wrist as harry made to move on. “we’re all going to keep fighting harry. you know that?” “yeah i — ” the suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence he could not go on. neville did not seem to find it strange. he patted harry on the shoulder released him and walked away to look for more bodies. harry swung the cloak back over himself and walked on. someone else was moving not far away stooping over another prone figure on the ground. he was feet away from her when he realized it was ginny. he stopped in his tracks. she was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother. “it’s all right,” ginny was saying. “it’s okay. we’re going to get you inside.” “but i want to go home,” whispered the girl. “i don’t want to fight anymore!” “i know,” said ginny and her voice broke. “it’s going to be all right.” ripples of cold undulated over harry’s skin. he wanted to shout out to the night he wanted ginny to know that he was there he wanted her to know where he was going. he wanted to be stopped to be dragged back to be sent back home. ... but he was home. hogwarts was the first and best home he had known. he and voldemort and snape the abandoned boys had all found home here. ... ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now holding her hand. with a huge effort harry forced himself on. he thought he saw ginny look around as he passed and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby but he did not speak and he did not look back. hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. there were no lights no sound of fang scrabbling at the door his bark booming in welcome. all those visits to hagrid and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire and rock cakes and giant grubs and his great bearded face and ron vomiting slugs and hermione helping him save norbert ... he moved on and now he reached the edge of the forest and he stopped. a swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees he could feel their chill and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. he had no strength left for a patronus. he could no longer control his own trembling. it was not after all so easy to die. every second he breathed the smell of the grass the cool air on his face was so precious to think that people had years and years time to waste so much time it dragged and he was clinging to each second. at the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on and knew that he must. the long game was ended the snitch had been caught it was time to leave the air. ... the snitch. his nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out. i open at the close. breathing fast and hard he stared down at it. now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible it seemed to have sped up and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. this was the close. this was the moment. he pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered “i am about to die.” the metal shell broke open. he lowered his shaking hand raised draco’s wand beneath the cloak and murmured “lumos.” the black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the snitch. the resurrection stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the elder wand. the triangle and circle representing the cloak and the stone were still discernible. and again harry understood without having to think. it did not matter about bringing them back for he was about to join them. he was not really fetching them they were fetching him. he closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. he knew it had happened because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy twig strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. he opened his eyes and looked around. they were neither ghost nor truly flesh he could see that. they resembled most closely the riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago and he had been memory made nearly solid. less substantial than living bodies but much more than ghosts they moved toward him and on each face there was the same loving smile. james was exactly the same height as harry. he was wearing the clothes in which he had died and his hair was untidy and ruffled and his glasses were a little lopsided like mr. weasley’s. sirius was tall and handsome and younger by far than harry had seen him in life. he loped with an easy grace his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. lupin was younger too and much less shabby and his hair was thicker and darker. he looked happy to be back in this familiar place scene of so many adolescent wanderings. lily’s smile was widest of all. she pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him and her green eyes so like his searched his face hungrily as though she would never be able to look at him enough. “you’ve been so brave.” he could not speak. his eyes feasted on her and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever and that would be enough. “you are nearly there,” said james. “very close. we are ... so proud of you.” “does it hurt?” the childish question had fallen from harry’s lips before he could stop it. “dying not at all,” said sirius. “quicker and easier than falling asleep.” “and he will want it to be quick. he wants it over,” said lupin. “i didn’t want you to die,” harry said. these words came without his volition. “any of you. i’m sorry — ” he addressed lupin more than any of them beseeching him. “ — right after you’d had your son ... remus i’m sorry “i am sorry too,” said lupin. “sorry i will never know him . . . but he will know why i died and i hope he will understand. i was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.” a chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at harry’s brow. he knew that they would not tell him to go that it would have to be his decision. “you’ll stay with me?” “until the very end,” said james. “they won’t be able to see you?” asked harry. “we are part of you,” said sirius. “invisible to anyone else.” harry looked at his mother. “stay close to me,” he said quietly. and he set off. the dementors’ chill did not overcome him he passed through it with his companions and they acted like patronuses to him and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together their branches tangled their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. harry clutched the cloak tightly around him in the darkness traveling deeper and deeper into the forest with no idea where exactly voldemort was but sure that he would find him. beside him making scarcely a sound walked james sirius lupin and lily and their presence was his courage and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. his body and mind felt oddly disconnected now his limbs working without conscious instruction as if he were passenger not driver in the body he was about to leave. the dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle ron hermione ginny and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life toward voldemort. ... a thud and a whisper some other living creature had stirred close by. harry stopped under the cloak peering around listening and his mother and father lupin and sirius stopped too. “someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “he’s got an invisibility cloak. could it be — ” two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree their wands flared and harry saw yaxley and dolohov peering into the darkness directly at the place harry his mother and father and sirius and lupin stood. apparently they could not see anything. “definitely heard something,” said yaxley. “animal d’you reckon?” “that head case hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said dolohov glancing over his shoulder. yaxley looked down at his watch. “time’s nearly up. potter’s had his hour. he’s not coming.” “and he was sure he’d come! he won’t be happy.” “better go back,” said yaxley. “find out what the plan is now.” he and dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. harry followed them knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. he glanced sideways and his mother smiled at him and his father nodded encouragement. they had traveled on mere minutes when harry saw light ahead and yaxley and dolohov stepped out into a clearing that harry knew had been the place where the monstrous aragog had once lived. the remnants of his vast web were there still but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the death eaters to fight for their cause. a fire burned in the middle of the clearing and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent watchful death eaters. some of them were still masked and hooded others showed their faces. two giants sat on the outskirts of the group casting massive shadows over the scene their faces cruel rough-hewn like rock. harry saw fenrir skulking chewing his long nails the great blond rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. he saw lucius malfoy who looked defeated and terrified and narcissa whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. every eye was fixed upon voldemort who stood with his head bowed and his white hands folded over the elder wand in front of him. he might have been praying or else counting silently in his mind and harry standing still on the edge of the scene thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and seek. behind his head still swirling and coiling the great snake nagini floated in her glittering charmed cage like a monstrous halo. when dolohov and yaxley rejoined the circle voldemort looked up. “no sign of him my lord,” said dolohov. voldemort ’s expression did not change. the red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. slowly he drew the elder wand between his long fingers. “my lord — ” bellatrix had spoken she sat closest to voldemort disheveled her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed. voldemort raised his hand to silence her and she did not speak another word but eyed him in worshipful fascination. “i thought he would come,” said voldemort in his high clear voice his eyes on the leaping flames. “i expected him to come.” nobody spoke. they seemed as scared as harry whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. his hands were sweating as he pulled off the invisibility cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes with his wand. he did not want to be tempted to fight. “i was it seems ... mistaken,” said voldemort. “you weren’t.” harry said it as loudly as he could with all the force he could muster he did not want to sound afraid. the resurrection stone slipped from between his numb fingers and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents sirius and lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. at that moment he felt that nobody mattered but voldemort. it was just the two of them. the illusion was gone as soon as it had come. the giants roared as the death eaters rose together and there were many cries gasps even laughter. voldemort had frozen where he stood but his red eyes had found harry and he stared as harry moved toward him with nothing but the fire between them. then a voice yelled “harry! no!” he turned hagrid was bound and trussed tied to a tree nearby. his massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled desperate. “no! no! harry what’re yeh — ” “quiet!” shouted rowle and with a flick of his wand hagrid was silenced. bellatrix who had leapt to her feet was looking eagerly from voldemort to harry her breast heaving. the only things that moved were the flames and the snake coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind voldemort’s head. harry could feel his wand against his chest but he made no attempt to draw it. he knew that the snake was too well protected knew that if he managed to point the wand at nagini fifty curses would hit him first. and still voldemort and harry looked at each other and now voldemort tilted his head a little to the side considering the boy standing before him and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth. “harry potter,” he said very softly. his voice might have been part of the spitting fire. “the boy who lived.” none of the death eaters moved. they were waiting everything was waiting. hagrid was struggling and bellatrix was panting and harry thought inexplicably of ginny and her blazing look and the feel of her lips on his — voldemort had raised his wand. his head was still tilted to one side like a curious child wondering what would happen if he proceeded. harry looked back into the red eyes and wanted it to happen now quickly while he could still stand before he lost control before he betrayed fear — he saw the mouth move and a flash of green light and everything was gone. king’s cross he lay facedown listening to the silence. he was perfectly alone. nobody was watching. nobody else was there. he was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. a long time later or maybe no time at all it came to him that he must exist must be more than disembodied thought because he was lying definitely lying on some surface. therefore he had a sense of touch and the thing against which he lay existed too. almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion harry became conscious that he was naked. convinced as he was of his total solitude this did not concern him but it did intrigue him slightly. he wondered whether as he could feel he would be able to see. in opening them he discovered that he had eyes. he lay in a bright mist though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. his surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. the floor on which he lay seemed to be white neither warm nor cold but simply there a flat blank something on which to be. he sat up. his body appeared unscathed. he touched his face. he was not wearing glasses anymore. then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him the small soft thumpings of something that flapped flailed and struggled. it was a pitiful noise yet also slightly indecent. he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive shameful. for the first time he wished he were clothed. barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. he took them and pulled them on they were soft clean and warm. it was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that the moment he had wanted them. ... he stood up looking around. was he in some great room of requirement the longer he looked the more there was to see. a great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. perhaps it was a palace. all was hushed and still except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. ... harry turned slowly on the spot and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. a wide-open space bright and clean a hall larger by far than the great hall with that clear domed glass ceiling. it was quite empty. he was the only person there except for — he recoiled. he had spotted the thing that was making the noises. it had the form of a small naked child curled on the ground its skin raw and rough flayed-looking and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left unwanted stuffed out of sight struggling for breath. he was afraid of it. small and fragile and wounded though it was he did not want to approach it. nevertheless he drew slowly nearer ready to jump back at any moment. soon he stood near enough to touch it yet he could not bring himself to do it. he felt like a coward. he ought to comfort it but it repulsed him. “you cannot help.” he spun around. albus dumbledore was walking toward him sprightly and upright wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. “harry.” he spread his arms wide and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. “you wonderful boy. you brave brave man. let us walk.” stunned harry followed as dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering leading him to two seats that harry had not previously noticed set some distance away under that high sparkling ceiling. dumbledore sat down in one of them and harry fell into the other staring at his old headmaster’s face. dumbledore ’s long silver hair and beard the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles the crooked nose everything was as he had remembered it. and yet... “but you’re dead,” said harry. “oh yes,” said dumbledore matter-of-factly. “then ... i’m dead too?” “ah,” said dumbledore smiling still more broadly. “that is the question isn’t it on the whole dear boy i think not.” they looked at each other the old man still beaming. “not?” repeated harry. “not,” said dumbledore. “but ...” harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. it did not seem to be there. “but i should have died — i didn’t defend myself! i meant to let him kill me!” “and that,” said dumbledore “will i think have made all the difference.” happiness seemed to radiate from dumbledore like light like fire harry had never seen the man so utterly so palpably content. “explain,” said harry. “but you already know,” said dumbledore. he twiddled his thumbs together. “i let him kill me,” said harry. “didn’t i?” “you did,” said dumbledore nodding. “go on!” “so the part of his soul that was in me ...” dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically urging harry onward a broad smile of encouragement on his face. ... has it gone?” “oh yes!” said dumbledore. “yes he destroyed it. your soul is whole and completely your own harry.” “but then ...” harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small maimed creature trembled under the chair. “what is that professor?” “something that is beyond either of our help,” said dumbledore. “but if voldemort used the killing curse,” harry started again “and nobody died for me this time — how can i be alive?” “i think you know,” said dumbledore. “think back. remember what he did in his ignorance in his greed and his cruelty.” harry thought. he let his gaze drift over his surroundings. if it was indeed a palace in which they sat it was an odd one with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there and still he and dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. then the answer rose to his lips easily without effort. “he took my blood,” said harry. “precisely!” said dumbledore. “he took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! your blood in his veins harry lily’s protection inside both of you! he tethered you to life while he lives!” “i live . . . while he lives but i thought ... i thought it was the other way round! i thought we both had to die or is it the same thing?” he was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. “are you sure we can’t do anything?” “there is no help possible.” “then explain ... more,” said harry and dumbledore smiled. “you were the seventh horcrux harry the horcrux he never meant to make. he had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil the murder of your parents the attempted killing of a child. but what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. he left more than his body behind. he left part of himself latched to you the would-be victim who had survived. “and his knowledge remained woefully incomplete harry! that which voldemort does not value he takes no trouble to comprehend. of house-elves and children’s tales of love loyalty and innocence voldemort knows and understands nothing. nothing. that they all have a power beyond his own a power beyond the reach of any magic is a truth he has never grasped. “he took your blood believing it would strengthen him. he took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. his body keeps her sacrifice alive and while that enchantment survives so do you and so does voldemort’s one last hope for himself.” dumbledore smiled at harry and harry stared at him. “and you knew this you knew — all along?” “i guessed. but my guesses have usually been good,” said dumbledore happily and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. “there’s more,” said harry. “there’s more to it. why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?” “as to that i cannot be sure.” “have a guess then,” said harry and dumbledore laughed. “what you must understand harry is that you and lord voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. but here is what i think happened and it is unprecedented and no wandmaker could i think ever have predicted it or explained it to voldemort. “without meaning to as you now know lord voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. a part of his soul was still attached to yours and thinking to strengthen himself he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. if he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice he would not perhaps have dared to touch your blood. ... but then if he had been able to understand he could not be lord voldemort and might never have murdered at all. “having ensured this two-fold connection having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. and now something very strange happened as we know. the cores reacted in a way that lord voldemort who never knew that your wand was twin of his had never expected. “he was more afraid than you were that night harry. you had accepted even embraced the possibility of death something lord voldemort has never been able to do. your courage won your wand overpowered his. and in doing so something happened between those wands something that echoed the relationship between their masters. “i believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of voldemort’s wand that night which is to say that it contained a little of voldemort himself. so your wand recognized him when he pursued you recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him magic much more powerful than anything lucius’s wand had ever performed. your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of voldemort’s own deadly skill what chance did that poor stick of lucius malfoy’s stand?” “but if my wand was so powerful how come hermione was able to break it?” asked harry. “my dear boy its remarkable effects were directed only at voldemort who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one i am sure,” dumbledore finished kindly. harry sat in thought for a long time or perhaps seconds. it was very hard to be sure of things like time here. “he killed me with your wand.” “he failed to kill you with my wand,” dumbledore corrected harry. “i think we can agree that you are not dead — though of course,” he added as if fearing he had been discourteous “i do not minimize your sufferings which i am sure were severe.” “i feel great at the moment though,” said harry looking down at his clean unblemished hands. “where are we exactly?” “well i was going to ask you that,” said dumbledore looking around. “where would you say that we are?” until dumbledore had asked harry had not known. now however he found that he had an answer ready to give. “it looks,” he said slowly “like king’s cross station. except a lot cleaner and empty and there are no trains as far as i can see.” “king’s cross station!” dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. “good gracious really?” “well where do you think we are?” asked harry a little defensively. “my dear boy i have no idea. this is as they say your party.” harry had no idea what this meant dumbledore was being infuriating. he glared at him then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. “the deathly hallows,” he said and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from dumbledore’s face. “ah yes,” he said. he even looked a little worried. “well?” for the first time since harry had met dumbledore he looked less than an old man much less. he looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. “can you forgive me?” he said. “can you forgive me for not trusting you for not telling you harry i only feared that you would fail as i had failed. i only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. i crave your pardon harry. i have known for some time now that you are the better man.” “what are you talking about?” asked harry startled by dumbledore’s tone by the sudden tears in his eyes. “the hallows the hallows,” murmured dumbledore. “a desperate man’s dream!” “but they’re real!” “real and dangerous and a lure for fools,” said dumbledore. “and i was such a fool. but you know don’t you i have no secrets from you anymore. you know.” “what do i know?” dumbledore turned his whole body to face harry and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. “master of death harry master of death! was i better ultimately than voldemort?” “of course you were,” said harry. “of course — how can you ask that you never killed if you could avoid it!” “true true,” said dumbledore and he was like a child seeking reassurance. “yet i too sought a way to conquer death harry.” “not the way he did,” said harry. after all his anger at dumbledore how odd it was to sit here beneath the high vaulted ceiling and defend dumbledore from himself. “hallows not horcruxes.” “hallows,” murmured dumbledore “not horcruxes. precisely.” there was a pause. the creature behind them whimpered but harry no longer looked around. “grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked. dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. “it was the thing above all that drew us together,” he said quietly. “two clever arrogant boys with a shared obsession. he wanted to come to godric’s hollow as i am sure you have guessed because of the grave of ignotus peverell. he wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.” “so it’s true?” asked harry. “all of it the peverell brothers — ” “ — were the three brothers of the tale,” said dumbledore nodding. “oh yes i think so. whether they met death on a lonely road ... i think it more likely that the peverell brothers were simply gifted dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. the story of them being death’s own hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. “the cloak as you know now traveled down through the ages father to son mother to daughter right down to ignotus’s last living descendant who was born as ignotus was in the village of godric’s hollow.” dumbledore smiled at harry. “me?” “you. you have guessed i know why the cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. james had showed it to me just a few days previously. it explained much of his undetected wrong-doing at school! i could hardly believe what i was seeing. i asked to borrow it to examine it. i had long since given up my dream of uniting the hallows but i could not resist could not help taking a closer look. ... it was a cloak the likes of which i had never seen immensely old perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died and i had two hallows at last all to myself!” his tone was unbearably bitter. “the cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive though,” harry said quickly. “voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. the cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.” “true,” sighed dumbledore. “true.” harry waited but dumbledore did not speak so he prompted him. “so you’d given up looking for the hallows when you saw the cloak?” “oh yes,” said dumbledore faintly. it seemed that he forced himself to meet harry’s eyes. “you know what happened. you know. you cannot despise me more than i despise myself.” “but i don’t despise you — ” “then you should,” said dumbledore. he drew a deep breath. “you know the secret of my sister’s ill health what those muggles did what she became. you know how my poor father sought revenge and paid the price died in azkaban. you know how my mother gave up her own life to care for ariana. “i resented it harry.” dumbledore stated it baldly coldly. he was looking now over the top of harry’s head into the distance. “i was gifted i was brilliant. i wanted to escape. i wanted to shine. i wanted glory. “do not misunderstand me,” he said and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. “i loved them. i loved my parents i loved my brother and my sister but i was selfish harry more selfish than you who are a remarkably selfless person could possibly imagine. “so that when my mother died and i was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother i returned to my village in anger and bitterness. trapped and wasted i thought! and then of course he came. ...” dumbledore looked directly into harry’s eyes again. “grindelwald. you cannot imagine how his ideas caught me harry inflamed me. muggles forced into subservience. we wizards triumphant. grindelwald and i the glorious young leaders of the revolution. “oh i had a few scruples. i assuaged my conscience with empty words. it would all be for the greater good and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. did i know in my heart of hearts what gellert grindelwald was i think i did but i closed my eyes. if the plans we were making came to fruition all my dreams would come true. “and at the heart of our schemes the deathly hallows! how they fascinated him how they fascinated both of us! the unbeatable wand the weapon that would lead us to power! the resurrection stone — to him though i pretended not to know it it meant an army of inferi! to me i confess it meant the return of my parents and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. “and the cloak ... somehow we never discussed the cloak much harry. both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the cloak the true magic of which of course is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. i thought that if we ever found it it might be useful in hiding ariana but our interest in the cloak was mainly that it completed the trio for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death which we took to mean ‘invincible.’ “invincible masters of death grindelwald and dumbledore! two months of insanity of cruel dreams and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. “and then ... you know what happened. reality returned in the form of my rough unlettered and infinitely more admirable brother. i did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. i did not want to hear that i could not set forth to seek hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. “the argument became a fight. grindelwald lost control. that which i had always sensed in him though i pretended not to now sprang into terrible being. and ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.” dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him he gripped his arm tightly and dumbledore gradually regained control. “well grindelwald fled as anyone but i could have predicted. he vanished with his plans for seizing power and his schemes for muggle torture and his dreams of the deathly hallows dreams in which i had encouraged him and helped him. he ran while i was left to bury my sister and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief the price of my shame. “years passed. there were rumors about him. they said he had procured a wand of immense power. i meanwhile was offered the post of minister of magic not once but several times. naturally i refused. i had learned that i was not to be trusted with power.” “but you’d have been better much better than fudge or scrimgeour!” burst out harry. “would i?” asked dumbledore heavily. “i am not so sure. i had proven as a very young man that power was my weakness and my temptation. it is a curious thing harry but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. those who like you have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantle because they must and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. “i was safer at hogwarts. i think i was a good teacher “you were the best — ” “ — you are very kind harry. but while i busied myself with the training of young wizards grindelwald was raising an army. they say he feared me and perhaps he did but less i think than i feared him. “oh not death,” said dumbledore in answer to harry’s questioning look. “not what he could do to me magically. i knew that we were evenly matched perhaps that i was a shade more skillful. it was the truth i feared. you see i never knew which of us in that last horrific fight had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. you may call me cowardly you would be right. harry i dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been i who brought about her death not merely through my arrogance and stupidity but that i actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. “i think he knew it i think he knew what frightened me. i delayed meeting him until finally it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. people were dying and he seemed unstoppable and i had to do what i could. “well you know what happened next. i won the duel. i won the wand.” another silence. harry did not ask whether dumbledore had ever found out who struck ariana dead. he did not want to know and even less did he want dumbledore to have to tell him. at last he knew what dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of erised and why dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over harry. they sat in silence for a long time and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed harry anymore. at last he said “grindelwald tried to stop voldemort going after the wand. he lied you know pretended he had never had it.” dumbledore nodded looking down at his lap tears still glittering on the crooked nose. “they say he showed remorse in later years alone in his cell at nurmengard. i hope that it is true. i would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. perhaps that lie to voldemort was his attempt to make amends ... to prevent voldemort from taking the hallow ...” ... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested harry and dumbledore dabbed his eyes. after another short pause harry said “you tried to use the resurrection stone.” dumbledore nodded. “when i discovered it after all those years buried in the abandoned home of the gaunts — the hallow i had craved most of all though in my youth i had wanted it for very different reasons — i lost my head harry. i quite forgot that it was now a horcrux that the ring was sure to carry a curse. i picked it up and i put it on and for a second i imagined that i was about to see ariana and my mother and my father and to tell them how very very sorry i was. ... “i was such a fool harry. after all those years i had learned nothing. i was unworthy to unite the deathly hallows i had proved it time and again and here was final proof.” “why?” said harry. “it was natural! you wanted to see them again. what’s wrong with that?” “maybe a man in a million could unite the hallows harry. i was fit only to possess the meanest of them the least extraordinary. i was fit to own the elder wand and not to boast of it and not to kill with it. i was permitted to tame and to use it because i took it not for gain but to save others from it. “but the cloak i took out of vain curiosity and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you its true owner. the stone i would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace rather than to enable my self-sacrifice as you did. you are the worthy possessor of the hallows.” dumbledore patted harry’s hand and harry looked up at the old man and smiled he could not help himself. how could he remain angry with dumbledore now “why did you have to make it so difficult?” dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. “i am afraid i counted on miss granger to slow you up harry. i was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. i was scared that if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects you might seize the hallows as i did at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. if you laid hands on them i wanted you to possess them safely. you are the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from death. he accepts that he must die and understands that there are far far worse things in the living world than dying.” “and voldemort never knew about the hallows?” “i do not think so because he did not recognize the resurrection stone he turned into a horcrux. but even if he had known about them harry i doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. he would not think that he needed the cloak and as for the stone whom would he want to bring back from the dead he fears the dead. he does not love.” “but you expected him to go after the wand?” “i have been sure that he would try ever since your wand beat voldemort’s in the graveyard of little hangleton. at first he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. once he had kidnapped ollivander however he discovered the existence of the twin cores. he thought that explained everything. yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! so voldemort instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong what gift you possessed that he did not naturally set out to find the one wand that they said would beat any other. for him the elder wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. he believes that the elder wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. poor severus ...” “if you planned your death with snape you meant him to end up with the elder wand didn’t you?” “i admit that was my intention,” said dumbledore “but it did not work as i intended did it?” “no,” said harry. “that bit didn’t work out.” the creature behind them jerked and moaned and harry and dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. the realization of what would happen next settled gradually over harry in the long minutes like softly falling snow. “i’ve got to go back haven’t i?” “that is up to you.” “i’ve got a choice?” “oh yes.” dumbledore smiled at him. “we are in king’s cross you say i think that if you decided not to go back you would be able to ... let’s say ... board a train.” “and where would it take me?” “on,” said dumbledore simply. silence again. “voldemort’s got the elder wand.” “true. voldemort has the elder wand.” “but you want me to go back?” “i think,” said dumbledore “that if you choose to return there is a chance that he may be finished for good. i cannot promise it. but i know this harry that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.” harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. “do not pity the dead harry. pity the living and above all those who live without love. by returning you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed fewer families are torn apart. if that seems to you a worthy goal then we say good-bye for the present.” harry nodded and sighed. leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been but it was warm and light and peaceful here and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. he stood up and dumbledore did the same and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces. “tell me one last thing,” said harry. “is this real or has this been happening inside my head?” dumbledore beamed at him and his voice sounded loud and strong in harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure. “of course it is happening inside your head harry but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”  the flaw in the plan he was lying facedown on the ground again. the smell of the forest filled his nostrils. he could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek and the hinge of his glasses which had been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple. every inch of him ached and the place where the killing curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. he did not stir but remained exactly where he had fallen with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping. he had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death but instead hurried footsteps whispers and solicitous murmurs filled the air. “my lord ...my lord ...” it was bellatrix’s voice and she spoke as if to a lover. harry did not dare open his eyes but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. he knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. a slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the invisibility cloak was also there stuffed out of sight. “my lord ...” “that will do,” said voldemort’s voice. more footsteps several people were backing away from the same spot. desperate to see what was happening and why harry opened his eyes by a millimeter. voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. various death eaters were hurrying away from him returning to the crowd lining the clearing. bellatrix alone remained behind kneeling beside voldemort. harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. the death eaters had been huddled around voldemort who seemed to have fallen to the ground. something had happened when he had hit harry with the killing curse. had voldemort too collapsed it seemed like it. and both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned. ... “my lord let me — ” “i do not require assistance,” said voldemort coldly and though he could not see it harry pictured bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. “the boy ... is he dead?” there was complete silence in the clearing. nobody approached harry but he felt their concentrated gaze it seemed to press him harder into the ground and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch. “you,” said voldemort and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain. “examine him. tell me whether he is dead.” harry did not know who had been sent to verify. he could only lie there with his heart thumping traitorously and wait to be examined but at the same time noting small comfort though it was that voldemort was wary of approaching him that voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan. ... hands softer than he had been expecting touched harry’s face pulled back an eyelid crept beneath his shirt down to his chest and felt his heart. he could hear the woman’s fast breathing her long hair tickled his face. he knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs. “is draco alive is he in the castle?” the whisper was barely audible her lips were an inch from his ear her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. “yes,” he breathed back. he felt the hand on his chest contract her nails pierced him. then it was withdrawn. she had sat up. “he is dead!” narcissa malfoy called to the watchers. and now they shouted now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet and through his eyelids harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. still feigning death on the ground he understood. narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter hogwarts and find her son was as part of the conquering army. she no longer cared whether voldemort won. “you see?” screeched voldemort over the tumult. “harry potter is dead by my hand and no man alive can threaten me now! watch! cruciov’ harry had been expecting it knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor it must be subjected to humiliation to prove voldemort’s victory. he was lifted into the air and it took all his determination to remain limp yet the pain he expected did not come. he was thrown once twice three times into the air his glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes but he kept himself floppy and lifeless and when he fell to the ground for the last time the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter. “now,” said voldemort “we go to the castle and show them what has become of their hero. who shall drag the body no — wait — ” there was a fresh outbreak of laughter and after a few moments harry felt the ground trembling beneath him. “you carry him,” voldemort said. “he will be nice and visible in your arms will he not pick up your little friend hagrid. and the glasses — put on the glasses — he must be recognizable — ” someone slammed harry’s glasses back onto his face with deliberate force but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. harry could feel hagrid ’s arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs great tears splashed down upon him as hagrid cradled harry in his arms and harry did not dare by movement or word to intimate to hagrid that all was not yet lost. “move,” said voldemort and hagrid stumbled forward forcing his way through the close-growing trees back through the forest. branches caught at harry’s hair and robes but he lay quiescent his mouth lolling open his eyes shut and in the darkness while the death eaters crowed all around them and while hagrid sobbed blindly nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of harry potter. . . . the two giants crashed along behind the death eaters harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky and even the jeers of the death eaters were drowned. the victorious procession marched on toward the open ground and after a while harry could tell by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids that the trees were beginning to thin. “bane!” hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced harry’s eyes open. “happy now are yeh that yeh didn’ fight yeh cowardly bunch o’ nags are yeh happy harry potter’s — d-dead...?” hagrid could not continue but broke down in fresh tears. harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass he dared not open his eyes to look. some of the death eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. a little later harry sensed by a freshening of the air that they had reached the edge of the forest. “stop.” harry thought that hagrid must have been forced to obey voldemort’s command because he lurched a little. and now a chill settled over them where they stood and harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. they would not affect him now. the fact of his own survival burned inside him a talisman against them as though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart. someone passed close by harry and he knew that it was voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the grounds crashing upon harry’s eardrums. “harry potter is dead. he was killed as he ran away trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. we bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. “the battle is won. you have lost half of your fighters. my death eaters outnumber you and the boy who lived is finished. there must be no more war. anyone who continues to resist man woman or child will be slaughtered as will every member of their family. come out of the castle now kneel before me and you shall be spared. your parents and children your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.” there was silence in the grounds and from the castle. voldemort was so close to him that harry did not dare open his eyes again. “come,” said voldemort and harry heard him move ahead and hagrid was forced to follow. now harry opened his eyes a fraction and saw voldemort striding in front of them wearing the great snake nagini around his shoulders now free of her enchanted cage. but harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the death eaters who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness. ... “harry,” sobbed hagrid. “oh harry ... harry ...” harry shut his eyes tight again. he knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish above the gleeful voices of the death eaters and their tramping footsteps signs of life from those within. “stop.” the death eaters came to a halt harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. he could see even through his closed lids the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. he waited. any moment the people for whom he had tried to die would see him lying apparently dead in hagrid ’s arms. “no!” the scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that professor mcgonagall could make such a sound. he heard another woman laughing nearby and knew that bellatrix gloried in mcgonagall’s despair. he squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of harry’s death for themselves. he saw voldemort standing a little in front of him stroking nagini’s head with a single white finger. he closed his eyes again. “no!” “ivo!” “harry! harry!” ron’s hermione’s and ginny’s voices were worse than mcgonagall’s harry wanted nothing more than to call back yet he made himself lie silent and their cries acted like a trigger the crowd of survivors took up the cause screaming and yelling abuse at the death eaters until — “silence!” cried voldemort and there was a bang and a flash of bright light and silence was forced upon them all. “it is over! set him down hagrid at my feet where he belongs!” harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. “you see?” said voldemort and harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. “harry potter is dead! do you understand now deluded ones he was nothing ever but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!” “he beat you!” yelled ron and the charm broke and the defenders of hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. “he was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said voldemort and there was relish in his voice for the lie “killed while trying to save himself — ” but voldemort broke off harry heard a scuffle and a shout then another bang a flash of light and a grunt of pain he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at voldemort harry saw the figure hit the ground disarmed voldemort throwing the challenger’s wand aside and laughing. “and who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?” bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. “it is neville longbottom my lord! the boy who has been giving the carrows so much trouble! the son of the aurors remember?” “ah yes i remember,” said voldemort looking down at neville who was struggling back to his feet unarmed and unprotected standing in the no-man ’s land between the survivors and the death eaters. “but you are a pureblood aren’t you my brave boy?” voldemort asked neville who stood facing him his empty hands curled in fists. “so what if i am?” said neville loudly. “you show spirit and bravery and you come of noble stock. you will make a very valuable death eater. we need your kind neville longbottom.” “i’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said neville. “dumbledore’s army!” he shouted and there was an answering cheer from the crowd whom voldemort’s silencing charms seemed unable to hold. “very well,” said voldemort and harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “if that is your choice longbottom we revert to the original plan. on your head,” he said quietly “be it.” still watching through his lashes harry saw voldemort wave his wand. seconds later out of one of the castle’s shattered windows something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in voldemort’s hand. he shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled empty and ragged the sorting hat. “there will be no more sorting at hogwarts school,” said voldemort. “there will be no more houses. the emblem shield and colors of my noble ancestor salazar slytherin will suffice for everyone. won’t they neville longbottom?” he pointed his wand at neville who grew rigid and still then forced the hat onto neville’s head so that it slipped down below his eyes. there were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle and as one the death eaters raised their wands holding the fighters of hogwarts at bay. “neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said voldemort and with a flick of his wand he caused the sorting hat to burst into flames. screams split the dawn and neville was aflame rooted to the spot unable to move and harry could not bear it he must act — and then many things happened at the same moment. they heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle uttering loud war cries. at the same time grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled “hagger!” his cry was answered by roars from voldemort’s giants they ran at grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. then came hooves and the twangs of bows and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the death eaters who broke ranks shouting their surprise. harry pulled the invisibility cloak from inside his robes swung it over himself and sprang to his feet as neville moved too. in one swift fluid motion neville broke free of the body-bind curse upon him the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver with a glittering rubied handle — the slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs and yet it seemed to draw every eye. with a single stroke neville sliced off the great snake’s head which spun high into the air gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall and voldemort’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet — hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry cast a shield charm between neville and voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. then over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants hagrid’s yell came loudest of all. “harry!” hagrid shouted. “harry — where’s harry?” chaos reigned. the charging centaurs were scattering the death eaters everyone was fleeing the giants’ stamping feet and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of voldemort’s giants thestrals and buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards defenders of hogwarts and death eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any death eater he could see and they crumpled not knowing what or who had hit them and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. still hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry was buffeted into the entrance hall he was searching for voldemort and saw him across the room firing spells from his wand as he backed into the great hall still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right harry cast more shield charms and voldemort’s would-be victims seamus finnigan and hannah abbott darted past him into the great hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it. and now there were more even more people storming up the front steps and harry saw charlie weasley overtaking horace slughorn who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. they seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of hogsmeade. the centaurs bane ronan and magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves as behind harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. the house-elves of hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers and at their head the locket of regulus black bouncing on his chest was kreacher his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din “fight! fight! fight for my master defender of house-elves! fight the dark lord in the name of brave regulus! fight!” they were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of death eaters their tiny faces alive with malice and everywhere harry looked death eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers overcome by spells dragging arrows from wounds stabbed in the leg by elves or else simply attempting to escape but swallowed by the oncoming horde. but it was not over yet harry sped between duelers past struggling prisoners and into the great hall. voldemort was in the center of the battle and he was striking and smiting all within reach. harry could not get a clear shot but fought his way nearer still invisible and the great hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. harry saw yaxley slammed to the floor by george and lee jordan saw dolohov fall with a scream at flitwick’s hands saw walden macnair thrown across the room by hagrid hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground. he saw ron and neville bringing down fenrir greyback aberforth stunning rookwood arthur and percy flooring thicknesse and lucius and narcissa malfoy running through the crowd not even attempting to fight screaming for their son. voldemort was now dueling mcgonagall slughorn and kingsley all at once and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him unable to finish him — bellatrix was still fighting too fifty yards away from voldemort and like her master she dueled three at once hermione ginny and luna all battling their hardest but bellatrix was equal to them and harry’s attention was diverted as a killing curse shot so close to ginny that she missed death by an inch — he changed course running at bellatrix rather than voldemort but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. “not my daughter you bitch!” mrs. weasley threw off her cloak as she ran freeing her arms. bellatrix spun on the spot roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger. “out of my way!” shouted mrs. weasley to the three girls and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. harry watched with terror and elation as molly weasley’s wand slashed and twirled and bellatrix lestrange’s smile faltered and became a snarl. jets of light flew from both wands the floor around the witches’ feet became hot and cracked both women were fighting to kill. “no!” mrs. weasley cried as a few students ran forward trying to come to her aid. “get back! get back ! she is mine!” hundreds of people now lined the walls watching the two fights voldemort and his three opponents bellatrix and molly and harry stood invisible torn between both wanting to attack and yet to protect unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. “what will happen to your children when i’ve killed you?” taunted bellatrix as mad as her master capering as molly’s curses danced around her. “when mummy’s gone the same way as freddie?” “you — will — never — touch — our — children — again!” screamed mrs. weasley. bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil and suddenly harry knew what was going to happen before it did. molly’s curse soared beneath bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest directly over her heart. bellatrix’s gloating smile froze her eyes seemed to bulge for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened and then she toppled and the watching crowd roared and voldemort screamed. harry felt as though he turned in slow motion he saw mcgonagall kingsley and slughorn blasted backward flailing and writhing through the air as voldemort ’s fury at the fall of his last best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. voldemort raised his wand and directed it at molly weasley. “protego\” roared harry and the shield charm expanded in the middle of the hall and voldemort stared around for the source as harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last. the yell of shock the cheers the screams on every side of “harry!” “he’s alive!” were stifled at once. the crowd was afraid and silence fell abruptly and completely as voldemort and harry looked at each other and began at the same moment to circle each other. “i don’t want anyone else to try to help,” harry said loudly and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “it’s got to be like this. it’s got to be me.” voldemort hissed. “potter doesn’t mean that,” he said his red eyes wide. “that isn’t how he works is it who are you going to use as a shield today potter?” “nobody,” said harry simply. “there are no more horcruxes. it’s just you and me. neither can live while the other survives and one of us is about to leave for good. ...” “one of us?” jeered voldemort and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared a snake that was about to strike. “you think it will be you do you the boy who has survived by accident and because dumbledore was pulling the strings?” “accident was it when my mother died to save me?” asked harry. they were still moving sideways both of them in that perfect circle maintaining the same distance from each other and for harry no face existed but voldemort’s. “accident when i decided to fight in that graveyard accident that i didn’t defend myself tonight and still survived and returned to fight again?” “accidents'.” screamed voldemort but still he did not strike and the watching crowd was frozen as if petrified and of the hundreds in the hall nobody seemed to breathe but they two. “accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you!” “you won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said harry as they circled and stared into each other’s eyes green into red. “you won’t be able to kill any of them ever again. don’t you get it i was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people — ” “but you did not!” “ — i meant to and that’s what did it. i’ve done what my mother did. they’re protected from you. haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding you can’t torture them. you can’t touch them. you don’t learn from your mistakes riddle do you?” “ you dare — ” “yes i dare,” said harry. “i know things you don’t know tom riddle. i know lots of important things that you don’t. want to hear some before you make another big mistake?” voldemort did not speak but prowled in a circle and harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay held back by the faintest possibility that harry might indeed know a final secret. ... “is it love again?” said voldemort his snake’s face jeering. “dumbledore’s favorite solution love which he claimed conquered death though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork love which did not prevent me stamping out your mudblood mother like a cockroach potter — and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. so what will stop you dying now when i strike?” “just one thing,” said harry and still they circled each other wrapped in each other held apart by nothing but the last secret. “if it is not love that will save you this time,” said voldemort “you must believe that you have magic that i do not or else a weapon more powerful than mine?” “i believe both,” said harry and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face though it was instantly dispelled voldemort began to laugh and the sound was more frightening than his screams humorless and insane it echoed around the silent hall. “you think you know more magic than i do?” he said. “than i than lord voldemort who has performed magic that dumbledore himself never dreamed of?” “oh he dreamed of it,” said harry “but he knew more than you knew enough not to do what you’ve done.” “you mean he was weak!” screamed voldemort. “too weak to dare too weak to take what might have been his what will be mine!” “no he was cleverer than you,” said harry “a better wizard a better man.” “i brought about the death of albus dumbledore!” “you thought you did,” said harry “but you were wrong.” for the first time the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. “dumbledore is dead\” voldemort hurled the words at harry as though they would cause him unendurable pain. “his body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle i have seen it potter and he will not return!” “yes dumbledore’s dead,” said harry calmly “but you didn’t have him killed. he chose his own manner of dying chose it months before he died arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.” “what childish dream is this?” said voldemort but still he did not strike and his red eyes did not waver from harry’s. “severus snape wasn’t yours,” said harry. “snape was dumbledore’s dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. and you never realized it because of the thing you can’t understand. you never saw snape cast a patronus did you riddle?” voldemort did not answer. they continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. “snape’s patronus was a doe,” said harry “the same as my mother’s because he loved her for nearly all of his life from the time when they were children. you should have realized,” he said as he saw voldemort’s nostrils flare “he asked you to spare her life didn’t he?” “he desired her that was all,” sneered voldemort “but when she had gone he agreed that there were other women and of purer blood worthier of him — ” “of course he told you that,” said harry “but he was dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her and he’s been working against you ever since! dumbledore was already dying when snape finished him!” “it matters not!” shrieked voldemort who had followed every word with rapt attention but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “it matters not whether snape was mine or dumbledore’s or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! i crushed them as i crushed your mother snape ’s supposed great love oh but it all makes sense potter and in ways that you do not understand! “dumbledore was trying to keep the elder wand from me! he intended that snape should be the true master of the wand! but i got there ahead of you little boy — i reached the wand before you could get your hands on it i understood the truth before you caught up. i killed severus snape three hours ago and the elder wand the deathstick the wand of destiny is truly mine! dumbledore ’s last plan went wrong harry potter!” “yeah it did,” said harry. “you’re right. but before you try to kill me i’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. ... think and try for some remorse riddle. ...” “what is this?” of all the things that harry had said to him beyond any revelation or taunt nothing had shocked voldemort like this. harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits saw the skin around his eyes whiten. “it’s your one last chance,” said harry “it’s all you’ve got left. ... i’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. ... be a man ... try ... try for some remorse. ...” “you dare — ” said voldemort again. “yes i dare,” said harry “because dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. it’s backfired on you riddle.” voldemort’s hand was trembling on the elder wand and harry gripped draco’s very tightly. the moment he knew was seconds away. “that wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. severus snape was never the true master of the elder wand. he never defeated dumbledore.” “he killed — ” “aren’t you listening snape never beat dumbledorel dumbledore’s death was planned between them! dumbledore intended to die undefeated the wand’s last true master! if all had gone as planned the wand’s power would have died with him because it had never been won from him!” “but then potter dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “i stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! i removed it against its last master’s wishes! its power is mine!” “you still don’t get it riddle do you possessing the wand isn’t enough! holding it using it doesn’t make it really yours. didn’t you listen to ollivander the wand chooses the wizard. ... the elder wand recognized a new master before dumbledore died someone who never even laid a hand on it. the new master removed the wand from dumbledore against his will never realizing exactly what he had done or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance. ...” voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly and harry could feel the curse coming feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. “the true master of the elder wand was draco malfoy.” blank shock showed in voldemort’s face for a moment but then it was gone. “but what does it matter?” he said softly. “even if you are right potter it makes no difference to you and me. you no longer have the phoenix wand we duel on skill alone ... and after i have killed you i can attend to draco malfoy. ...” “but you’re too late,” said harry. “you’ve missed your chance. i got there first. i overpowered draco weeks ago. i took this wand from him.” harry twitched the hawthorn wand and he felt the eyes of everyone in the hall upon it. “so it all comes down to this doesn’t it?” whispered harry. “does the wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed because if it does ... i am the true master of the elder wand.” a red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. the light hit both of their faces at the same time so that voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens pointing draco’s wand “avada kedavrav’ “ expelliarmus ” the bang was like a cannon blast and the golden flames that erupted between them at the dead center of the circle they had been treading marked the point where the spells collided. harry saw voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell saw the elder wand fly high dark against the sunrise spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of nagini spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill who had come to take full possession of it at last. and harry with the unerring skill of the seeker caught the wand in his free hand as voldemort fell backward arms splayed the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. tom riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality his body feeble and shrunken the white hands empty the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. voldemort was dead killed by his own rebounding curse and harry stood with two wands in his hand staring down at his enemy’s shell. one shivering second of silence the shock of the moment suspended and then the tumult broke around harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. the fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him and the first to reach him were ron and hermione and it was their arms that were wrapped around him their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. then ginny neville and luna were there and then all the weasleys and hagrid and kingsley and mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout and harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting nor tell whose hands were seizing him pulling him trying to hug some part of him hundreds of them pressing in all of them determined to touch the boy who lived the reason it was over at last — the sun rose steadily over hogwarts and the great hall blazed with life and light. harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning of grief and celebration. they wanted him there with them their leader and symbol their savior and their guide and that he had not slept that he craved the company of only a few of them seemed to occur to no one. he must speak to the bereaved clasp their hands witness their tears receive their thanks hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on that the imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves that death eaters were fleeing or else being captured that the innocent of azkaban were being released at that very moment and that kingsley shacklebolt had been named temporary minister of magic. ... they moved voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the hall away from the bodies of fred tonks lupin colin creevey and fifty others who had died fighting him. mcgonagall had replaced the house tables but nobody was sitting according to house anymore all were jumbled together teachers and pupils ghosts and parents centaurs and house elves and firenze lay recovering in a corner and grawp peered in through a smashed window and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. after a while exhausted and drained harry found himself sitting on a bench beside luna. “i’d want some peace and quiet if it were me,” she said. “i’d love some,” he replied. “i’ll distract them all,” she said. “use your cloak.” and before he could say a word she had cried “oooh look a blibbering humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. everyone who heard looked around and harry slid the cloak up over himself and got to his feet. now he could move through the hall without interference. he spotted ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder there would be time to talk later hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. he saw neville the sword of gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. along the aisle between the tables he walked and he spotted the three malfoys huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there but nobody was paying them any attention. everywhere he looked he saw families reunited and finally he saw the two whose company he craved most. “it’s me,” he muttered crouching down between them. “will you come with me?” they stood up at once and together he ron and hermione left the great hall. great chunks were missing from the marble staircase part of the balustrade gone and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed. somewhere in the distance they could hear peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition we did it we bashed them wee potter’s the one and voldy’s gone moldy so now let’s have fun! “really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing doesn’t it?” said ron pushing open a door to let harry and hermione through. happiness would come harry thought but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion and the pain of losing fred and lupin and tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. most of all he felt the most stupendous relief and a longing to sleep. but first he owed an explanation to ron and hermione who had stuck with him for so long and who deserved the truth. painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the pensieve and what had happened in the forest and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking though none of them had mentioned their destination. since he had last seen it the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided looking a little punch-drunk and harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. “can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle. “feel free,” groaned the statue. they clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. harry pushed open the door at the top. he had one brief glimpse of the stone pensieve on the desk where he had left it and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out thinking of curses and returning death eaters and the rebirth of voldemort but it was applause. all around the walls the headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted dilys derwent sobbed unashamedly dexter fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet and phineas nigellus called in his high reedy voice “and let it be noted that slytherin house played its part! let our contribution not be forgotten!” but harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. tears were sliding down from behind the half moon spectacles into the long silver beard and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled harry with the same balm as phoenix song. at last harry held up his hands and the portraits fell respectfully silent beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. he directed his words at dumbledore however and chose them with enormous care. exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was he must make one last effort seeking one last piece of advice. “the thing that was hidden in the snitch,” he began “i dropped it in the forest. i don’t know exactly where but i’m not going to go looking for it again. do you agree?” “my dear boy i do,” said dumbledore while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. “a wise and courageous decision but no less than i would have expected of you. does anyone else know where it fell?” “no one,” said harry and dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. “i’m going to keep ignotus’s present though,” said harry and dumbledore beamed. “but of course harry it is yours forever until you pass it on!” “and then there’s this.” harry held up the elder wand and ron and hermione looked at it with a reverence that even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state harry did not like to see. “i don’t want it,” said harry. “what?” said ron loudly. “are you mental?” “i know it’s powerful,” said harry wearily. “but i was happier with mine. so ...” he rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather. hermione had said that they could not be repaired that the damage was too severe. all he knew was that if this did not work nothing would. he laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk touched it with the very tip of the elder wand and said “reparo.” as his wand resealed red sparks flew out of its end. harry knew that he had succeeded. he picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. “i’m putting the elder wand,” he told dumbledore who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration “back where it came from. it can stay there. if i die a natural death like ignotus its power will be broken won’t it the previous master will never have been defeated. that’ll be the end of it.” dumbledore nodded. they smiled at each other. “are you sure?” said ron. there was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the elder wand. “i think harry’s right,” said hermione quietly. “that wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said harry. “and quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in gryffindor tower and wondering whether kreacher might bring him a sandwich there “i’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.” ayue nineteen years later autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. the morning of the first of september was crisp and golden as an apple and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing the owls inside them hooted indignantly and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers clutching her father’s arm. “it won’t be long and you’ll be going too,” harry told her. “two years,” sniffed lily. “i want to go now\” the commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. albus’s voice drifted back to harry over the surrounding clamor his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. “i won’ti i won’t be in slytherin!” “james give it a rest!” said ginny. “i only said he might be,” said james grinning at his younger brother. “there’s nothing wrong with that. he might be in slyth — ” but james caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. the five potters approached the barrier. with a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother james took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. a moment later he had vanished. “you’ll write to me won’t you?” albus asked his parents immediately capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. “every day if you want us to,” said ginny. “not every day,” said albus quickly. “james says most people only get letters from home about once a month.” “we wrote to james three times a week last year,” said ginny. “and you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about hogwarts,” harry put in. “he likes a laugh your brother.” side by side they pushed the second trolley forward gathering speed. as they reached the barrier albus winced but no collision came. instead the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet hogwarts express. indistinct figures were swarming through the mist into which james had already disappeared. “where are they?” asked albus anxiously peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. “well find them,” said ginny reassuringly. but the vapor was dense and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces. detached from their owners voices sounded unnaturally loud. harry thought he heard percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. ... “i think that’s them al,” said ginny suddenly. a group of four people emerged from the mist standing alongside the very last carriage. their faces only came into focus when harry ginny lily and albus had drawn right up to them. “hi,” said albus sounding immensely relieved. rose who was already wearing her brand-new hogwarts robes beamed at him. “parked all right then?” ron asked harry. “i did. hermione didn’t believe i could pass a muggle driving test did you she thought i’d have to confund the examiner.” “no i didn’t,” said hermione “i had complete faith in you.” “as a matter of fact i did confund him,” ron whispered to harry as together they lifted albus ’s trunk and owl onto the train. “i only forgot to look in the wing mirror and let’s face it i can use a supersensory charm for that.” back on the platform they found lily and hugo rose’s younger brother having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to hogwarts. “if you’re not in gryffindor we’ll disinherit you,” said ron “but no pressure.” “ron\” lily and hugo laughed but albus and rose looked solemn. “he doesn’t mean it,” said hermione and ginny but ron was no longer paying attention. catching harry’s eye he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. the steam had thinned for a moment and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. “look who it is.” draco malfoy was standing there with his wife and son a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. his hair was receding somewhat which emphasized the pointed chin. the new boy resembled draco as much as albus resembled harry. draco caught sight of harry ron hermione and ginny staring at him nodded curtly and turned away again. “so that’s little scorpius,” said ron under his breath. “make sure you beat him in every test rosie. thank god you inherited your mother’s brains.” “ron for heaven’s sake,” said hermione half stern half amused. “don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!” “you’re right sorry,” said ron but unable to help himself he added “don’t get too friendly with him though rosie. granddad weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.” “hey!” james had reappeared he had divested himself of his trunk owl and trolley and was evidently bursting with news. “teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “just seen him! and guess what he’s doing snogging victoire\” he gazed up at the adults evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. “our teddy! teddy lupin snogging our victoire! our cousin! and i asked teddy what he was doing — ” “you interrupted them?” said ginny. “you are so like ron — ” “ — and he said he’d come to see her off! and then he told me to go away. he’s snogging her!” james added as though worried he had not made himself clear. “oh it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered lily ecstatically. “teddy would really be part of the family then!” “he already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said harry. “why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?” “yeah!” said james enthusiastically. “i don’t mind sharing with a1 — teddy could have my room!” “no,” said harry firmly “you and a1 will share a room only when i want the house demolished.” he checked the battered old watch that had once been fabian prewett’s. “it’s nearly eleven you’d better get on board.” “don’t forget to give neville our love!” ginny told james as she hugged him. “mum! i can’t give a professor love\” “but you know neville — ” james rolled his eyes. “outside yeah but at school he’s professor longbottom isn’t he i can’t walk into herbology and give him love. ...” shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at albus. “see you later al. watch out for the thestrals.” “i thought they were invisible you said they were invisible !” but james merely laughed permitted his mother to kiss him gave his father a fleeting hug then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. they saw him wave then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. “thestrals are nothing to worry about,” harry told albus. “they’re gentle things there’s nothing scary about them. anyway you won’t be going up to school in the carriages you’ll be going in the boats.” ginny kissed albus good-bye. “see you at christmas.” “bye al,” said harry as his son hugged him. “don’t forget hagrid’s invited you to tea next friday. don’t mess with peeves. don’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. and don’t let james wind you up.” “what if i’m in slytherin?” the whisper was for his father alone and harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. harry crouched down so that albus ’s face was slightly above his own. alone of harry’s three children albus had inherited lily’s eyes. “albus severus,” harry said quietly so that nobody but ginny could hear and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose who was now on the train “you were named for two headmasters of hogwarts. one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew.” “but just say — ” “ — then slytherin house will have gained an excellent student won’t it it doesn’t matter to us al. but if it matters to you you’ll be able to choose gryffindor over slytherin. the sorting hat takes your choice into account.” “really?” “it did for me,” said harry. he had never told any of his children that before and he saw the wonder in albus’s face when he said it. but now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses last-minute reminders. albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. students were hanging from the windows nearest them. a great number of faces both on the train and off seemed to be turned toward harry. “why are they all staring?” demanded albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students. “don’t let it worry you,” said ron. “it’s me. i’m extremely famous.” albus rose hugo and lily laughed. the train began to move and harry walked alongside it watching his son’s thin face already ablaze with excitement. harry kept smiling and waving even though it was like a little bereavement watching his son glide away from him. ... the last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. the train rounded a corner. harry’s hand was still raised in farewell. “he’ll be all right,” murmured ginny. as harry looked at her he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. “i know he will.” the scar had not pained harry for nineteen years. all was well.
